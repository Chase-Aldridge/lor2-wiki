## Description

A well-established Duergar mining and slaving colony from CTHON. The dark dwarves have come to PLAGAS to pillage the rich natural ore veins, capture valuable Leonin and Loxodon slaves, and gather the various rare plant and monster raw materials of the jungle continent.

The oldest and most powerful colony known on this wild land, they are hesitant to welcome outsiders though they do employ ample bounty hunters, monster trappers, and mercenary forces internationally.

The Red Mane Tribe is in active conflict with Fort Runestone:

This conflict is brutal and ongoing, with no quarter given by either side.

### White Fang Tribe - Contested Territory

White Fang hunting parties have been spotted moving toward the coast to contest Fort Runestone's expansion. Their legendary hunting skills make them dangerous opponents even for duergar forces.

### Loxodon Shamans - Memory Manipulation
Any Fort Runestone expeditions encountering the elusive Loxodon shamans report memory loss, making it difficult for the colony to effectively operate in the central jungle.
