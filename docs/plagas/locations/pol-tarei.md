## Description

A free city of unknown founding deep in the southern islands largely run by sailors, pirates, hunters, and mercenaries from across LOR. Here some freed leonin and loxodon slaves as well as those claiming to be from the jungle tribes have begun to integrate with the denizens from other lands.

The city largely organizes merchant fleets and jungle expeditions for profit, having even done recent business with THE EXPLORER'S ASSOCIATION.
