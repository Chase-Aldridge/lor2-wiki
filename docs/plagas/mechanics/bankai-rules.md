## Unlocking Bankai

### Requirements

- **Will be unlocked once you have a big "feel something" moment in the plot**
  - Must be a significant emotional or narrative moment
  - Connected to your character's personal journey
  - DM will work with you to identify the right moment

- **Needs to tie into your lore and/or existing class abilities somehow**
  - Should feel like a natural extension of your character
  - Reflects your character's growth and power
  - Mechanically synergistic with your build

- **Auto-Unlock at Level 13:** If you haven't "lore unlocked" Bankai by level 13, you'll naturally learn it then

---

## Activation Requirements

### Action Economy Cost
- **Uses full action AND bonus action for that turn**
- Cannot be used alongside other major actions
- Represents the intense focus required to unleash this power

### Cooldown
- **Can't use again for 1d8 days after that**
- Roll the d8 after Bankai ends to determine exact cooldown
- Represents the strain on body and spirit
- More powerful Bankai abilities may have longer cooldowns (DM discretion)

---

## Duration

### Combat Abilities
- **Only lasts 1 minute** if combat ability
- Enough time for a full combat encounter
- Must make every second count

### Utility Abilities
- **Could last up to 10 minutes** depending on DM approval
- Non-combat applications may have longer duration
- Balanced based on power level and narrative appropriateness

---

## Creating Your Bankai

### Design Philosophy
- **Can be an attack, ability, spell, and/or aura**
- **Near limitless options** to create what it does
- You tell the DM what you're thinking
- DM will assign the dice, rolls, checks, etc.

### Trade-Offs System
- **Will be trade-offs** built into every Bankai
- If you go pure offense, might have defense debuff
- High damage might come with self-damage or exhaustion
- Powerful utility might leave you vulnerable
- Balance is key to preventing overpowered abilities

### Example Trade-Offs
- Massive damage boost → Reduced AC or HP
- Area control → Limited movement
- Powerful buff → Subsequent debuff after duration ends
- Multiple effects → Shorter duration or longer cooldown

---

## Power Scaling

### Enhanced Power Level
- **Bankai is stronger now** than in the first campaign
- Can override most other actions or buffs from enemies
- Represents your character at their absolute peak

### Limitations
- **CANNOT override:**
  - Legendary enemies' abilities
  - Other Bankai
  - Domain Expansions
  - Reality-warping divine powers

---

## The Three Levels of Bankai

## Strategic Considerations

- Trade-offs would be crippling in current situation

### Party Coordination
- Communicate before using Bankai
- Allies can maximize your Bankai's effect
- Some Bankai may have friendly fire considerations
- Domain Expansions can affect party members (plan accordingly!)

- Any secondary effects?

### Step 3: Balance

- Determine appropriate trade-offs
- Set duration and cooldown
- Test in play and adjust as needed

### Step 4: Evolution
- How will it grow into Ultimate Bankai?
- What would your Domain Expansion look like?
