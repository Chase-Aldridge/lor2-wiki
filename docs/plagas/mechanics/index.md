## Combat Mechanics

### Using Bankai Strategically
- **Save for critical moments** - Boss fights, dire situations
- **Coordinate with party** - Maximize impact
- **Consider trade-offs** - Make sure drawbacks won't cripple you
- **Timing is everything** - 1 minute is longer than you think

### Action Economy Mastery (Level 15+)
- **Two bonus actions** - Double the swift actions
- **Two reactions** - Respond to multiple threats
- **Maintain concentration** - While doing more things
- **Complex tactics** - Chain abilities together

### Trade-Off Management
Every powerful ability has a cost:
- Offensive power → Defensive vulnerability
- Area effects → Self-risk
- Buff → Subsequent debuff
- Multiple effects → Shorter duration
