## Special Level Abilities

### Level 13: Bankai Unlock (Auto)
**"The Awakening"**

If you haven't unlocked your Bankai through a dramatic story moment by level 13, you'll naturally learn it at this level.

- Represents sufficient power and experience to manifest ultimate ability
- Still should tie into your character's themes and class
- Work with DM to determine how it manifests

See [Bankai Rules](bankai-rules.md) for complete details.

---

### Level 14: Extra Reaction
**"Heightened Reflexes"**

**You'll get 1 extra reaction per turn**

This represents your character's enhanced combat awareness and ability to respond to multiple threats.

#### Mechanical Benefits
- Can use 2 reactions per round instead of 1
- Allows for:
  - Opportunity attacks + defensive reactions
  - Multiple counterspells/defensive abilities
  - More flexible tactical positioning
  - Better protection for allies

#### Strategic Implications
- Dramatically improves battlefield control
- Tanks can protect more allies
- Spellcasters can counter more threats

- **Wizard:** Counterspell + Shield
- **Rogue:** Two opportunity attacks for Sneak Attack
- **Paladin:** Opportunity attack + Defensive reaction for ally

---

### Level 15: Extra Bonus Action
**"Surging Power"**

**One extra bonus action per turn**

Your character has reached such mastery that they can perform multiple swift actions in the span of seconds.

#### Mechanical Benefits
- Can use 2 bonus actions per round instead of 1
- Allows for:
  - Multiple bonus action attacks
  - Bonus action spell + bonus action ability
  - Greater action economy flexibility
  - Incredible burst damage potential

#### Strategic Implications
- Massive increase in action economy

- **Rogue:** Cunning Action + bonus action attack
- **Bard:** Bardic Inspiration + bonus action spell
- **Fighter:** Two-Weapon Fighting + Commander's Strike
- **Ranger:** Hunter's Mark + Healing Spirit

#### Important Limitations
- Still only ONE spell of 1st level or higher per turn (if applicable)
- Subject to same concentration rules
- DM may rule certain combinations inappropriate
- Action economy is powerful but not game-breaking

---

### Level 18: ???
**"The Unknown Threshold"**

Something significant happens at level 18, but the DM has kept this secret.

#### Speculation
Could be:
- **Domain Expansion unlock?** (if not already achieved)
- **Legendary Resistances?** Player characters gain legendary saves
- **Mythic Transformation?** Ascension to near-demigod status
- **Reality Manipulation?** Ability to alter fate or outcomes
- **??? Form?** The mysterious Level 4 beyond Domain Expansion

The only certainty is that it will be powerful and game-changing.

---

## Standard D&D Progression

### Remember You Also Get
- All standard class features at their respective levels
- ASIs/Feats at standard intervals (4, 8, 12, 16, 19)
- Proficiency bonus increases
- Spell slot progression (for casters)
- HP increases per level

The special abilities are **in addition to** standard progression, making high-level characters in this campaign exceptionally powerful.

## Level Milestone Summary

| Level | Special Ability | Impact |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| 13 | Bankai (Auto-unlock) | Ultimate power technique |
| 14 | +1 Reaction/turn | Enhanced battlefield awareness |
| 15 | +1 Bonus Action/turn | Increased action economy |
| 18 | ??? | Unknown but significant |

---

## Build Considerations

### Reaction-Heavy Builds
Get enormous value from Level 14:
- Battlemaster Fighters
- Abjuration Wizards
- Sentinel feat users
- Protection Fighting Style
- Polearm Master builds

### Bonus Action-Heavy Builds
Become incredibly powerful at Level 15:
- Monks (Flurry of Blows)
- Two-Weapon Fighting builds
- Spiritual Weapon clerics
- Cunning Action rogues
- Bonus action spell users

### Bankai-Focused Builds
Plan around your ultimate ability:
- What class features synergize?
- How does extra action economy help your Bankai?
- What's your Domain Expansion concept?

---

## Multiclassing Considerations

### Extra Actions Benefit All Classes
- Multiclass builds gain full benefit
- Action economy improvements aren't class-specific
- Opens up more viable multiclass combinations
- Single-class builds still get unique high-level features

### Bankai Scaling
- Work with DM on how Bankai scales with multiclassing
- Generally should scale with character level, not class level
- Represents personal power, not just class training

---

## Comparison to Standard 5E

### Standard 5E High Level
- 1 Action, 1 Bonus Action, 1 Reaction per round
- Ultimate power from 9th level spells
- Class capstones at level 20

### Plagas Campaign High Level
- 1 Action, **2 Bonus Actions**, **2 Reactions** per round (at 15+)
- Ultimate power from Bankai/Domain Expansion
- Class capstones PLUS special abilities
- Level 18 mystery
- Overall significantly more powerful

---

## Roleplaying Level Milestones

- Shift in how world perceives you

### Level 15: Surging Power
- Energy courses through you

---

## DM Notes for Players

### Pacing
- These abilities are intentionally powerful
- Encounters will be scaled appropriately
- You're meant to feel awesome
- Still challenged but not overwhelmed

### Balance
- These affect all PCs equally (milestone leveling)
- No power imbalance within party
- Enemies also gain enhanced abilities at high levels
- Legendary enemies already have multiple actions

### Narrative Justification
- You're meant to be legendary heroes
- Following in Rusitauri footsteps
- World needs heroes of this caliber
- Threats are correspondingly epic

*Grow stronger. Master your abilities. Become legend.*
