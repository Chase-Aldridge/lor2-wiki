### Toad Rot

**Effects:** Unknown from source material

**Cultural Impact:**

**Speculation:**

## Alcohol (For Comparison)

While not a narcotic, alcohol is commonly consumed and has known effects:

**Effects:**
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Benefit:** +1 STR

**Note:** The double penalty makes alcohol generally less desirable than the narcotics for most purposes, except for Strength-based characters who don't need mental stats for their immediate task.

## The Addiction System

### The Baja Blast Incident

When **Keel drank the small blue potion** (called "Baja Blast" by players), he gained the ability to tell time and date accurately - a seemingly permanent benefit. However, he also became **addicted** to the substance.

This suggests the campaign uses an addiction mechanic where:
- Beneficial effects may be semi-permanent
- Addiction is a real consequence
- Substances from The Sapphire Tower are especially potent/dangerous
- Even beneficial addictions are still problematic

### Implications for Narcotics
- Regular use of Jungle grass, Sweet wheat, etc. may cause addiction
- DM may track usage and require saves
- Addiction could impose penalties when not using
- Withdrawal symptoms possible

---

## Economic Impact

### Black Market Trade
- **The Octopus** runs the black market in Pol Tarei
- Narcotics likely a major profit center
- Competition between dealers
- Smuggling operations from other continents (tomb honey)

### Colonial Economies
- Narcotics may be taxed or illegal depending on colony
- Fort Runestone likely has strict laws
- Pol Tarei appears more permissive
- Lozenberg probably has open trade

### Indigenous Trade
- Jungle grass and sweet wheat likely come from indigenous territories
- May be major trade goods with colonies
- Leonin and Loxodon relationship to narcotics unknown
- Could be sacred substances or just cash crops

---

## The Sapphire Tower's Role

### Magical Potions vs Narcotics

The Sapphire Tower merchants sell mysterious potions:
- **2 Blue potions**
- **2 Green potions**
- **2 Red potions**
- **1 Purple potion**

**Gray tiefling lead merchant** makes "wild claims" about their effects.

The "Baja Blast" blue potion that Keel consumed came from this source, suggesting:
- Sapphire Tower creates powerful substances
- Effects may be magical rather than purely alchemical
- Addiction potential is high
- Benefits can be permanent or semi-permanent
- Much more expensive than street narcotics

---

## Legal Status by Colony

### Pol Tarei
- **Likely legal or tolerated**
- Openly discussed in taverns
- Sold on streets
- No mention of law enforcement against users
- Part of normal economy

### Fort Runestone
- **Probably illegal for slaves, controlled for citizens**
- Duergar/Drow strict society
- May use substances for control
- Unlikely to tolerate unauthorized use

### Lozenberg
- **Definitely legal**
- Lawless free city
- Anything goes
- Major trade hub for narcotics

### The Sapphire Tower
- **Unknown - possibly experimental subjects**
- Creating magical alternatives
- May view traditional narcotics as primitive
- Focus on alchemical/magical enhancement

### Windrun
- **Probably illegal**
- Lawful society with strict codes
- Warforged don't need substances
- Visitors likely prohibited from use

## Strategic Considerations for Players

### Combat Preparation
- **Before tough fight:** Sweet wheat for +1 CON
- **Scouting mission:** Jungle grass for +1 WIS (Perception)
- **Straight melee:** Alcohol for +1 STR (if you don't need mental stats)

### Social Situations
- **Avoid sweet wheat** (-1 CHA)
- **Avoid alcohol** (-1 WIS and INT)
- **Jungle grass acceptable** if you don't need Intelligence

### Exploration
- **Jungle grass good** for Perception and Survival
- **Sweet wheat good** for endurance challenges
- **Alcohol generally bad** for exploration

### Risks
- Addiction mechanics may apply
- Expensive over time
- May be illegal in some areas
- Social stigma possible
- Long-term health effects unknown
