# THE PLAGAS PROPHECY

**"THE SEQUEL TO THE AETERNUM CRISIS"**

5E Campaign Created and DM'd by Kevin Orosz

## THE WORLD: LOR

LOR is the planet we are on, a super-continental world with a huge oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known (the planet is about 130% larger than the Earth we know). Interestingly the extreme poles of the world are subtropical or tundra, and the ice belt is closer to the equator. The planet has shifted dramatically since "The Aeternum Crisis" four years ago as the winds of magic have changed and geopolitics have opened up…

## THE CONTINENT: PLAGAS

The campaign opens with our new heroes meeting one another on the massive rainforest and desertified archipelago continent to the far west…PLAGAS. This is a land of wild mystery, lawlessness, titanic monster hunts, colonization, loxodon plant shamanism, and ruthless leonin tribal politics. Very few of the other civilizations have managed to gain a foothold other than colonies on the lands of PLAGAS due to the extreme danger posed by the thick jungles, unforgiving beasts roaming the lands, and the secretive indigenous leonin tribes that hunt there. Much is unknown at the start of 1116AE when our heroes begin their quest…
