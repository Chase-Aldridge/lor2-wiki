# Plagas - The Savage Frontier

*"The Sequel to the Aeternum Crisis"*

**Campaign Created and DM'd by:** Kevin Orosz

---

## THE WORLD: LOR

LOR is the planet we are on, a super-continental world with a huge oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known (the planet is about 130% larger than the Earth we know). Interestingly the extreme poles of the world are subtropical or tundra, and the ice belt is closer to the equator. The planet has shifted dramatically since "The Aeternum Crisis" four years ago as the winds of magic have changed and geopolitics have opened up…

---

## THE CONTINENT: PLAGAS

The campaign opens with our new heroes meeting one another on the massive rainforest and desertified archipelago continent to the far west…PLAGAS. This is a land of wild mystery, lawlessness, titanic monster hunts, colonization, loxodon plant shamanism, and ruthless leonin tribal politics. Very few of the other civilizations have managed to gain a foothold other than colonies on the lands of PLAGAS due to the extreme danger posed by the thick jungles, unforgiving beasts roaming the lands, and the secretive indigenous leonin tribes that hunt there. Much is unknown at the start of 1116AE when our heroes begin their quest…

## EPILOGUE

It has been 4 years since the events of the "AETERNUM CRISIS" and the fall of the magical mist surrounding humanity's continent AETERNUM on LOR. The year is 1116AE according to their calendar…

### CHANGES IN AETERNUM

After NEJUNE's total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant", an ancient evil seemed to seep into the ruins and surrounding lands in the form of a violet miasma, cursing the crops and peoples with eldritch magic. Many whisper this is due to the 7 seals being finally broken since the dawn era 1000 years ago... The surviving smaller city states south of NEJUNE barely eke out a living being ruled by militias of surviving mages, constantly set upon by undead and hordes of raiders.

BLACK FANG "The Void Walker", NERO VALUS "The Immortal", and the Illithid Lord known as THE PANTOKRATOR allegedly engage in a titanic magical & psionic duel over the ruins of MAGUS RISE at the end of 1111AE. The results of the battle and the combatants' survival are unknown; the ruins are declared off-limits officially by the major kingdoms in the wake of these reports.

The original pantheon of demigods born from mortals during the dawn era on AETERNUM: Lokhir, Alaya, Heronmius, Bel'Mog, Oberon & Leira have all but lost their power and influence, mysteriously going silent in 1112AE to their followers and cultists. Many scholars theorize this was the ultimate effect of the winds of magic being sealed and then released again during the "end times" events when Kronus was banished from the Material Plane.

It is dreamt by many prophets and seers that worship BAHAMUT, DRACONISS, & LEVIATHAN that the goodly metallic dragon gods have chosen not to show themselves yet to the peoples of AETERNUM as they did in the dawn era…it is not known why. Though many aspirants made for THE ISLE OF THE DRAGON and sought refuge within the guarded TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT to await this future day.

AENARION THE HAWK [the only surviving avatar of SILVANUS] remains missing in action... though many believe he is either the new FELLWOOD elven warlord "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" or is backing/training him…

THE QUNARI sent word to the major kingdoms through their aasimar chaplains in 1112AE that "Qunari Rule" shall return in 10 years and a day since the start of the "end times prophecy" triggered in 1111AE. Meaning in 1121AE the major houses of AETERNUM will have to meet in ritual atop the holy mountain LOKHIRS SUMMIT to decide the continents future fate. There is much contention around this still politically with the newfound peace and shaky stability….

GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT, and many of the other furry forest friends of the realm slowly return to a cleansed FELLWOOD to find it full of bountiful nut, fruit, and berry…

PELOR, the neutral good god of the sun and agriculture has gained a large cult following among the commoners in all kingdoms of AETERNUM following the end of the crisis, due to the influx of traders worshiping in his name from GUL'RATH.

The sale, use, and illicit trade in tomb honey has grown swiftly in MERIA and has now even entered the black markets in DARGO and small villages in THE FELLWOOD

AETHERIUS is now a demilitarized city zone of trade and political movings ruled over by a joint council from MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD

THE ARKEN COMPANY is officially disbanded, and their assassin forces are absorbed back into the GUILD. FORT BANE is converted into a trade port as part of MERIA.

Settlers continue to arrive from and depart to THE EMERALD ISLES via DARGO, as the peoples slowly integrate with the human locals and establish larger colonies.

The DRACONISS dragonborn found their own island village named WAJA-SAN to honor their sensei and his peaceful death in 1112AE. KISHIMOTO DRACONBLADE becomes the new master of THE SOUL WASHERS with BENGROR THE MIGHTY as his right hand sword; they begin training the next generation in the ways of Dragon Bushido. YURIO ZARASHI aids in the training of the youthful samurai, solidly seen as the third sword of the village.

MISTRAYA finally dies of old age in 1113AE as ALAYA's power wanes…ARCA and ELDRATHA marry, and continue the traditions of the moon elves & the practice of life magic to become renowned master healers in the EMERALD ISLES.

CHRISTOF CALADEN and THE COLLECTOR become some of the richest individuals in the realm, gaining a feared duo reputation for gambling Ws and keen trade deals with the blessing and political might of THE GUILD

LUAN BO "The Celestial Tiger" refounds a dojo and temple to THE CONIN in DARGO, and begins training the next generation in his way Da'Shon starting in 1112AE.

THE GUILD has slowly, unbeknownst to much of the populace, subjected them to its "benevolent" propaganda & instilled a new secular, meritocratic philosophy known as "The Oath" which has taken root now four years later. This system promotes the formation of artisan guilds, a banishing of noble houses, and the rise of the common man through the sweat and blood of his labors and genius.

In MERIA, the human and dwarven council has now voted in a matriarchal duo of powerful female leaders to guide the new vision of the rebuilt mercantile capital; led by LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR & LADY NYNORA due to their cunning political maneuvering surrounding trade, making their kingdom the strongest by far on AETERNUM [under the watchful thumb of The Voice and his Guild council]

GUILDMASTER OREON, LU ZHONG THE TIGER, GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS, and RYUZEN THE DRUNKEN PHOENIX become the new warlords heading MERIA's elite mercenary force known as THE TWILIGHT REAVERS. They amass a large military and trade fleet and set sail north in 1114AE into the uncharted seas with the blessing of THE VOICE using old maps from the dawn era….

THANES HOLD has slowly been retaken and resettled [with help from GUILD and MERIA forces] by the dwarves of CLAN THORGREM in a brutal war of attrition with the remnants of greenskin RED HORDE. The plutocracy of the dwarven merchant guilds under the iron fist of HIGH KING THANOR are now in ascendancy once more as they reopen trade and return to their top economic monopolies on forged goods and ores.

DARGO underwent political chaos as the steward COUNT QUERLOS went missing and the rising CULT OF DRAGONSPEAR seized power [with shadowy GUILD assistance] and installed a semi-dictatorship resembling a monarchy. Forsaken were purged from the city and the people overthrew the nobility. The throne remains empty as PRINCE FAGREN DRAGONSPEAR and his younger sister PRINCESS HERA DRAGONSPEAR were both found dead soon after the new council of powers met at the end of 1111AE; the new steward is a priest from the cult known as "RYLAND THE PIOUS". KING BEREN, GEREN THE WARHAMMER, and KING ZADSHEN are all revered as saints because of their sacrifices.

In the FELLWOOD, a peerless elven warrior known as "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" has gathered a band of hunters and mercenaries and now runs the power channels of those lands in shadow. Rumors say it is the broken and unpredictable AENARION himself, though others claimed he died in battle during the end of the war…

Sadly it is feared the forsaken have been either genocided into extinction or exile after the peoples of southern AETERNUM learned of the DARGO elites' dealings with the illithids. Some claim the few surviving mutants were saved due to their psionic gifts and headed south by sea to THE EMERALD ISLES….

CICERO WINDBLADE remains the right hand of THE VOICE, and the two now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits. BOREAS THE OX and his entire elite hit squad are slain while hunting the trail of BLACK FANG however as the GUILD seeks to tie up loose ends in 1111AE. They now set their sights on expanding their power to other continents through strong trade alliances, beginning with GUL'RATH as THE EXPLORER'S ASSOCIATION made contact with MERIA in 1112AE.

Delegations of emissaries and small military fleets from CTHON and FORTEA arrived in 1114AE on AETERNUM'S shores and the results of their meetings are unknown as they were not made public.

No official contact with REGELUM has been reported

THE RED HORDE remnants are said to have largely moved their tribes and warbands underground into the Underdark near and around THE MOUTH OF WOE as the forces of order gained power after 1111AE.

Small elite bands of bounty hunters, rogue pirates, brigands, and caravans of traders from the lawless ZONOS continue to sneak into THE GRAY WASTES from its northern shores and battle the greenskin hordes and titanic beasts there. They have been rumored to clash with THORGREM and MERIA forces from time to time, and have been said to have retaken the ruins of THE GRAY GATE.

### THE LEGEND OF THE RUSITAURI

The fatetouched heroes regrouped after the fall of NEJUNE and assisted THE VOICE as members of THE GUILD council in brokering a new, albeit tenuous geopolitical peace on AETERNUM. Seen as legendary protectors of the realm by many and political-extremist vigilantes by others, they helped guide the newly formed council of the continent to stabilize and rebuild the kingdoms of MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD before departing on their own personal quests.

Given leave and considerable political and financial rewards from THE GUILD, the heroes decided to tie up loose ends and finish their business on the continent to depart for the next chapter. Their staff, followers, equipment, fleet, and armory have all now been established both within the GUILD tower inside MERIA as well as in THE SHADOW CITADEL in LIMBO, formerly the slain KET's headquarters which now serves as the throne for THE VOICE.

The heroes journeyed to THE MOUTH OF WOE at the end of 1111AE to aid EGGBERT in finding the sealed resting place of his wife and finally let her go, releasing her body from suspended magical animation and letting death "officially" take her. METAGAMUS appears to EGGBERT in a dream and reveals the radically different life paths that now lay before him…

End of 1111AE: Due to the breaking of OBERON's power as a god in the Fey Court, the demigod starts to fade from the plane and his hold on the FEYWILD is no more. Other Fey Nobles fight for power of the throne and in the chaos the disembodied soul of ULRICK escapes & is accidentally planeshifted into the twin heaven plane of BYTOPIA. There a benevolent wind djinn discovers him and seals him in a pure adamantine jar, later befriending and bargaining with the hero…towards fates unknown.

In the start of 1112AE with the aid of a broken AMAUD STURNSTAR and a returned half-demon ELENA DRAGONSONG they were able to re-enter the hell plane of PANDEMONIUM and confront its lord GARAGOS to battle for the return of the soul of their fallen comrade ZADSHEN DRAGONSPEAR. In a twist of fate much to ODA and SHO's dismay, EGGBERT offered his soul heroically in exchange and now lies tortured and bound for eternity there instead, giving the gnome some ironic respite from the chaos of meaninglessness of his life without his wife. ZADSHEN is reborn into a new human body, psychologically worn down from [his planar perspective] 17 years of torture at the hands of GARAGOS chose not to return to AETERNUM and instead to retire and serve as an acolyte to THE QUNARI atop MOUNT CELESTIA to fulfill his oath, seek redemption, and live out his remaining years as a mortal aasimar.

Seeing EGGBERT sacrifice himself, as well as the broken ZAD changed SHO and ODA. SHO especially started to really go within himself and question everything. ODA suspected potentially a remnant mark from the DEMON OF RAGE had colored SHO permanently as he became more aggressive on their trek to REGELUM. Upon landing they were assaulted by an army of THE RED SHOGUN, JIREN SAI. They killed around 1,000 kobold and lizardfolk ashigaru + dragonborn samurai before being captured. The prophecy from SHO's encounter with THE PROPHET OF BAHAMUT then came to be as JIREN ordered SHO commit seppuku, however ODA used his domain at the last second to conceal them and they were able to planeshift out of the RED SHOGUN's castle. The two got separated from there and this is where their lore becomes rumor... ODA returned to DARGO and the temple of the CONIN with LUAN BO to train a new generation and craft his own personal martial art. SHO returned to REGELUM as an avenger and began a rebellion against the RED SHOGUN after he was overcome with rage with the plight of the dragonborn people.

## UNEXPLORED TERRITORIES

**The Za'an Ruins**
Said to be a legendary "Forebearer" city lost to time hidden among the jungles. Treasure hunters and explorers disagree on its exact location though many have sought it, few seemed to have survived…

**The Golden City**
One of the favorite myths and legends told around gambling tables by drunken sailors across LOR…a rumored citadel of vast riches watched over by the most sacred orders of Loxodon and Leonin warriors and shamans. Many scholars dismiss its actual existence citing the savage's inability to actually raise cities…

**The Red Mane Tribe**
Known to be savage and ruthless in war, and their raiding parties still make it to the coastal colonies every few years. Their territories and hunting grounds are believed to run through the entire northern reaches of rainforest.

**The White Fang Tribe**
Said to rule over the southern jungles and apparently are peerless monster hunters and trappers. They seem to be even more elusive than their counterparts, and no jungle explorer or seafaring trader seems to ever return to tell their tale…

**The Nameless Faction**
A third and more mysterious nameless faction is said to exist somewhere in the central jungle hills that are believed to be the sacred class of Loxodon shamans and medicine men who mediate between the major warring leonin tribes…

**Other Legends**
Countless other rumors and legends persist among the colonies of ancient tombs, geomantic ley lines, sentient monsters, titanic bestial spawning grounds, lost cities, treasure hoardes, and even planar portals hidden among the dense rainforests of PLAGAS….

## PANTHEON OF GODS IN PLAGAS

### The Three Titans of Creation

The first beings that incarnated in our multiverse and then created the planes, the planet Lor, and all the other gods. This would be being discussed in the Lozenberg camp by certain scholarly wizards from Gul'Rath.

#### Exarian, the Titan of Light

First and oldest of the Titans, created light and matter itself, has never been described or seen in all the annals of the ancient elves and dwarves of Lor, believed to sit atop his own plane above all creation writing in THE WORLDTOME, a book of metareality that already contains past/present/future.

**Status:** Mythological

#### Kronos, Titan of Time

Second and darkest of the Titans, created temporality and mortality itself, worshipped by some factions within the MAGISTERIUM and some planar cults who hope to curry his dark favor.

His dark avatar was summoned and then miraculously banished by the "fatetouched" of The Rusitarui during the Aeternum Crisis of 1111AE, nearly trapping the continent into a deathly magical stasis.

**Status:** Mythological

#### Alariel, Titan of Magic

Third and youngest of the Titans, created the weave + winds of magic and spellcraft in its primordial form.

Was key in helping her older brother Exarian in creating the various pantheons of gods to rule over their domains, while also protecting them from the devouring appetite of Kronos. She has many forms + names in every culture, and yet her planar intercessions are rare.

**Status:** Mythological

---

### Other Planar Entities

**Baba Yaga**
Hag Mother of the Fey

**The Raven Queen**
Keeper of the order

**Syre**
Craftsman of creation
