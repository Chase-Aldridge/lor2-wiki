# The Legend of the Rusitauri

## Overview

The fatetouched heroes regrouped after the fall of NEJUNE and assisted THE VOICE as members of THE GUILD council in brokering a new, albeit tenuous geopolitical peace on AETERNUM. Seen as legendary protectors of the realm by many and political-extremist vigilantes by others, they helped guide the newly formed council of the continent to stabilize and rebuild the kingdoms of MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD before departing on their own personal quests.

## Their Legacy Secured

Given leave and considerable political and financial rewards from THE GUILD, the heroes decided to tie up loose ends and finish their business on the continent to depart for the next chapter. Their staff, followers, equipment, fleet, and armory have all now been established both within the GUILD tower inside MERIA as well as in THE SHADOW CITADEL in LIMBO, formerly the slain KET's headquarters which now serves as the throne for THE VOICE.

## EGGBERT'S SACRIFICE

### The Mouth of Woe (End of 1111AE)

The heroes journeyed to THE MOUTH OF WOE at the end of 1111AE to aid EGGBERT in finding the sealed resting place of his wife and finally let her go, releasing her body from suspended magical animation and letting death "officially" take her. METAGAMUS appears to EGGBERT in a dream and reveals the radically different life paths that now lay before him…

### The Hell Bargain (Early 1112AE)

In the start of 1112AE with the aid of a broken AMAUD STURNSTAR and a returned half-demon ELENA DRAGONSONG they were able to re-enter the hell plane of PANDEMONIUM and confront its lord GARAGOS to battle for the return of the soul of their fallen comrade ZADSHEN DRAGONSPEAR.

In a twist of fate much to ODA and SHO's dismay, EGGBERT offered his soul heroically in exchange and now lies tortured and bound for eternity there instead, giving the gnome some ironic respite from the chaos of meaninglessness of his life without his wife.

ZADSHEN is reborn into a new human body, psychologically worn down from [his planar perspective] 17 years of torture at the hands of GARAGOS chose not to return to AETERNUM and instead to retire and serve as an acolyte to THE QUNARI atop MOUNT CELESTIA to fulfill his oath, seek redemption, and live out his remaining years as a mortal aasimar.

## ULRICK'S ESCAPE

### The Fey Court Falls (End of 1111AE)

Due to the breaking of OBERON's power as a god in the Fey Court, the demigod starts to fade from the plane and his hold on the FEYWILD is no more. Other Fey Nobles fight for power of the throne and in the chaos the disembodied soul of ULRICK escapes & is accidentally planeshifted into the twin heaven plane of BYTOPIA.

There a benevolent wind djinn discovers him and seals him in a pure adamantine jar, later befriending and bargaining with the hero…towards fates unknown.

## SHO AND ODA: THE REGELUM REBELLION

### The Change

Seeing EGGBERT sacrifice himself, as well as the broken ZAD changed SHO and ODA. SHO especially started to really go within himself and question everything. ODA suspected potentially a remnant mark from the DEMON OF RAGE had colored SHO permanently as he became more aggressive on their trek to REGELUM.

### The Red Shogun's Assault

Upon landing they were assaulted by an army of THE RED SHOGUN, JIREN SAI. They killed around 1,000 kobold and lizardfolk ashigaru + dragonborn samurai before being captured.

The prophecy from SHO's encounter with THE PROPHET OF BAHAMUT then came to be as JIREN ordered SHO commit seppuku, however ODA used his domain at the last second to conceal them and they were able to planeshift out of the RED SHOGUN's castle.

### Separate Paths

The two got separated from there and this is where their lore becomes rumor...

**ODA** returned to DARGO and the temple of the CONIN with LUAN BO to train a new generation and craft his own personal martial art.

**SHO** returned to REGELUM as an avenger and began a rebellion against the RED SHOGUN after he was overcome with rage with the plight of the dragonborn people.

## The Heroes Now

The Rusitauri have scattered to the winds, each pursuing their own destiny:

- **EGGBERT** - Trapped eternally in Pandemonium, tortured by Garagos
- **ZADSHEN** - Reborn as an aasimar acolyte on Mount Celestia
- **ULRICK** - Soul sealed in an adamantine jar in Bytopia
- **ODA** - Training the next generation in Dargo
- **SHO** - Leading a rebellion in Regelum

Their legend lives on in songs like "The Ballad of the Rusitauri" performed by bards across LOR, and their deeds have inspired a new generation of heroes to rise...
