# Prologue: Changes in Aeternum

## EPILOGUE

It has been 4 years since the events of the "AETERNUM CRISIS" and the fall of the magical mist surrounding humanity's continent AETERNUM on LOR. The year is 1116AE according to their calendar…

## CHANGES IN AETERNUM

### The Aftermath of NEJUNE

After NEJUNE's total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant", an ancient evil seemed to seep into the ruins and surrounding lands in the form of a violet miasma, cursing the crops and peoples with eldritch magic. Many whisper this is due to the 7 seals being finally broken since the dawn era 1000 years ago...

The surviving smaller city states south of NEJUNE barely eke out a living being ruled by militias of surviving mages, constantly set upon by undead and hordes of raiders.

### The Battle at Magus Rise

BLACK FANG "The Void Walker", NERO VALUS "The Immortal", and the Illithid Lord known as THE PANTOKRATOR allegedly engage in a titanic magical & psionic duel over the ruins of MAGUS RISE at the end of 1111AE. The results of the battle and the combatants' survival are unknown; the ruins are declared off-limits officially by the major kingdoms in the wake of these reports.

### The Silent Gods

The original pantheon of demigods born from mortals during the dawn era on AETERNUM: Lokhir, Alaya, Heronmius, Bel'Mog, Oberon & Leira have all but lost their power and influence, mysteriously going silent in 1112AE to their followers and cultists. Many scholars theorize this was the ultimate effect of the winds of magic being sealed and then released again during the "end times" events when Kronus was banished from the Material Plane.

### The Dragon Gods Wait

It is dreamt by many prophets and seers that worship BAHAMUT, DRACONISS, & LEVIATHAN that the goodly metallic dragon gods have chosen not to show themselves yet to the peoples of AETERNUM as they did in the dawn era…it is not known why. Though many aspirants made for THE ISLE OF THE DRAGON and sought refuge within the guarded TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT to await this future day.

### Aenarion's Fate

AENARION THE HAWK [the only surviving avatar of SILVANUS] remains missing in action... though many believe he is either the new FELLWOOD elven warlord "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" or is backing/training him…

### The Qunari Prophecy

THE QUNARI sent word to the major kingdoms through their aasimar chaplains in 1112AE that "Qunari Rule" shall return in 10 years and a day since the start of the "end times prophecy" triggered in 1111AE. Meaning in 1121AE the major houses of AETERNUM will have to meet in ritual atop the holy mountain LOKHIRS SUMMIT to decide the continents future fate. There is much contention around this still politically with the newfound peace and shaky stability….

### Minor Events

- GOOD CHEESE, GOOD NUT, and many of the other furry forest friends of the realm slowly return to a cleansed FELLWOOD to find it full of bountiful nut, fruit, and berry…
- PELOR, the neutral good god of the sun and agriculture has gained a large cult following among the commoners in all kingdoms of AETERNUM following the end of the crisis, due to the influx of traders worshiping in his name from GUL'RATH.
- The sale, use, and illicit trade in tomb honey has grown swiftly in MERIA and has now even entered the black markets in DARGO and small villages in THE FELLWOOD

## POLITICAL CHANGES

### Aetherius
AETHERIUS is now a demilitarized city zone of trade and political movings ruled over by a joint council from MERIA, DARGO, and THANES HOLD

### The Arken Company
THE ARKEN COMPANY is officially disbanded, and their assassin forces are absorbed back into the GUILD. FORT BANE is converted into a trade port as part of MERIA.

### The Emerald Isles Integration
Settlers continue to arrive from and depart to THE EMERALD ISLES via DARGO, as the peoples slowly integrate with the human locals and establish larger colonies.

---

## THE DRACONISS AND WAJA-SAN

The DRACONISS dragonborn found their own island village named WAJA-SAN to honor their sensei and his peaceful death in 1112AE. KISHIMOTO DRACONBLADE becomes the new master of THE SOUL WASHERS with BENGROR THE MIGHTY as his right hand sword; they begin training the next generation in the ways of Dragon Bushido. YURIO ZARASHI aids in the training of the youthful samurai, solidly seen as the third sword of the village.

### Moon Elf Legacy
MISTRAYA finally dies of old age in 1113AE as ALAYA's power wanes…ARCA and ELDRATHA marry, and continue the traditions of the moon elves & the practice of life magic to become renowned master healers in the EMERALD ISLES.

---

## THE GUILD'S RISE TO POWER

### Economic Dominance
CHRISTOF CALADEN and THE COLLECTOR become some of the richest individuals in the realm, gaining a feared duo reputation for gambling Ws and keen trade deals with the blessing and political might of THE GUILD

### Da'Shon Temple
LUAN BO "The Celestial Tiger" refounds a dojo and temple to THE CONIN in DARGO, and begins training the next generation in his way Da'Shon starting in 1112AE.

### "The Oath" - A New Philosophy
THE GUILD has slowly, unbeknownst to much of the populace, subjected them to its "benevolent" propaganda & instilled a new secular, meritocratic philosophy known as "The Oath" which has taken root now four years later. This system promotes the formation of artisan guilds, a banishing of noble houses, and the rise of the common man through the sweat and blood of his labors and genius.

---

## MERIA'S TRANSFORMATION

In MERIA, the human and dwarven council has now voted in a matriarchal duo of powerful female leaders to guide the new vision of the rebuilt mercantile capital; led by LADY ELLYSSA RORINSTAR & LADY NYNORA due to their cunning political maneuvering surrounding trade, making their kingdom the strongest by far on AETERNUM [under the watchful thumb of The Voice and his Guild council]

### The Twilight Reavers
GUILDMASTER OREON, LU ZHONG THE TIGER, GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS, and RYUZEN THE DRUNKEN PHOENIX become the new warlords heading MERIA's elite mercenary force known as THE TWILIGHT REAVERS. They amass a large military and trade fleet and set sail north in 1114AE into the uncharted seas with the blessing of THE VOICE using old maps from the dawn era….

---

## THANES HOLD RECLAIMED

THANES HOLD has slowly been retaken and resettled [with help from GUILD and MERIA forces] by the dwarves of CLAN THORGREM in a brutal war of attrition with the remnants of greenskin RED HORDE. The plutocracy of the dwarven merchant guilds under the iron fist of HIGH KING THANOR are now in ascendancy once more as they reopen trade and return to their top economic monopolies on forged goods and ores.

---

## DARGO'S UPHEAVAL

DARGO underwent political chaos as the steward COUNT QUERLOS went missing and the rising CULT OF DRAGONSPEAR seized power [with shadowy GUILD assistance] and installed a semi-dictatorship resembling a monarchy. Forsaken were purged from the city and the people overthrew the nobility. The throne remains empty as PRINCE FAGREN DRAGONSPEAR and his younger sister PRINCESS HERA DRAGONSPEAR were both found dead soon after the new council of powers met at the end of 1111AE; the new steward is a priest from the cult known as "RYLAND THE PIOUS". KING BEREN, GEREN THE WARHAMMER, and KING ZADSHEN are all revered as saints because of their sacrifices.

---

## THE FELLWOOD'S SHADOW RULER

In the FELLWOOD, a peerless elven warrior known as "THE VIRIDIAN WOLF" has gathered a band of hunters and mercenaries and now runs the power channels of those lands in shadow. Rumors say it is the broken and unpredictable AENARION himself, though others claimed he died in battle during the end of the war…

---

## THE FORSAKEN'S FATE

Sadly it is feared the forsaken have been either genocided into extinction or exile after the peoples of southern AETERNUM learned of the DARGO elites' dealings with the illithids. Some claim the few surviving mutants were saved due to their psionic gifts and headed south by sea to THE EMERALD ISLES….

---

## THE VOICE AND CICERO

CICERO WINDBLADE remains the right hand of THE VOICE, and the two now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits. BOREAS THE OX and his entire elite hit squad are slain while hunting the trail of BLACK FANG however as the GUILD seeks to tie up loose ends in 1111AE. They now set their sights on expanding their power to other continents through strong trade alliances, beginning with GUL'RATH as THE EXPLORER'S ASSOCIATION made contact with MERIA in 1112AE.

---

## INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

### New Contacts
Delegations of emissaries and small military fleets from CTHON and FORTEA arrived in 1114AE on AETERNUM'S shores and the results of their meetings are not made public.

### Regelum - No Contact
No official contact with REGELUM has been reported

---

## THE RED HORDE'S RETREAT

THE RED HORDE remnants are said to have largely moved their tribes and warbands underground into the Underdark near and around THE MOUTH OF WOE as the forces of order gained power after 1111AE.

---

## ZONOS RAIDERS IN THE GRAY WASTES

Small elite bands of bounty hunters, rogue pirates, brigands, and caravans of traders from the lawless ZONOS continue to sneak into THE GRAY WASTES from its northern shores and battle the greenskin hordes and titanic beasts there. They have been rumored to clash with THORGREM and MERIA forces from time to time, and have been said to have retaken the ruins of THE GRAY GATE.
