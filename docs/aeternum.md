THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BLADE
“The Rúsitauri” 
The Sons of the Forest 
“THE AETERNUM CRISIS”


[Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition campaign set and setting by Kevin Orosz]

THE WORLD: LOR
LOR is the planet and world we find ourselves in the story so far. Tales and myths have been told about the formation of the world by the gods since the birth of the younger races. Various dogmas and schools of thought exist as far as timelines and metaphysical truths are concerned, however the reality is no one really knows. This world is presumably full of nations and empires of all the major races. Including those from beyond the Material Plane creatures of all types inhabit LOR, a vast super-continental and oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known (the planet is about 130% larger than the Earth we know).
THE CONTINENT: AETERNUM
Our adventurers find themselves embroiled in the drama of one major continent where they were born in the world of LOR, AETERNUM. Recorded history begins over 1,000 years ago on the continent in 0AE with the founding myths of the first elves and dwarves. This land is ruled primarily by the intrigues, wars, treaties, and pacts of power between 4 major houses. Interestingly the people of AETERNUM have not had contact with any of the other continents of LOR for over 300 years [since around 800AE], curiously no one is truly aware of why and have generally stopped asking. HOUSE AETHERIUS, the strongest of the houses militarily, has assured the citizens of AETERNUM that the magical mists encircling the continent are impenetrable from within or without, whether through shipping lanes or even magical means. This had led to a very traditional history of repression and yet a culturally unique situation on the continent: with men, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and fouler races generally vying for power over the rich but limited natural resources of their massive island. Currently it is the dawn of the year 1111AE by the calendar of the land, and generally the tenuous peace of the last 40 years has been shattered by recent events. A foreboding alliance between HOUSE AETHERIUS and HOUSE DARGO has shifted the status quo between the generally held “good” races of men, elves, and dwarves. Meanwhile a new orc warlord has launched a crusade of terror via his freshly amassed horde, assaulting outlying settlements and disrupting trading routes across the north of the land. The adventuring party however finds themselves brought together by Fate in an opulent tavern in the coastal lands of HOUSE MERIA. Glory, riches, brotherhood, and mystery now awaits….

THE STORY SO FAR
ACT I: THE CALL
CHAPTER I “A FATED MEETING”
1111.1AE
Level 1
Our adventuring party first find themselves meeting under lucky auspices around pints of ale in the famous tavern in Meria THE LAUGHING DRAGON. A dragonborn samurai, a wild human paladin, a wood elf rogue, an aasimar paladin, and a mute human cleric all gather round a table and eye one another curiously…
They soon find themselves offered 2 dangerous mercenary jobs by the venerable dwarven barkeep BRORNOR BATTLEHAND. They retire for the night but not before generously tipping the famous gnome bard in residence GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS. That night they manage to fend off an insidious assassination attempt by ninja operatives of THE GOLDEN ORDER. The next day they make for the western reaches of The Gray Hills to hunt a certain wanted goblin scouting party. In the early hours of the morning they manage to engage a small pack of goblin cutthroats and triumph, slowly learning more about one another through battle and fellowship…
CHAPTER II “THE FIRST HUNT”
1111.1AE
Level 2
The fellowship continues their goblin hunt north-northeast along THE NORTH ROAD leading from MERIA to THANE’S HOLD. On the road they encounter an AETHERIUS trade caravan that had been attacked by ogres, losing two of their in guard company. Speaking with them they gain news that THE GRAY GATE is under attack and calling for aid. Though wary of the adventuring party, the soldiers warn them that the lands of the GRAY HILLS are dangerous for any on the road. On the path ahead they slay a wounded ogre before making camp. A surviving & bleeding Aetherius soldier comes to their campfire for aid and thanks them before departing to catch up with his comrades. Further on the hilly way they slay a band of kobolds looting a dwarven trade captain’s body, and later discover his sizable trade company decimated along the roadside. Reading their merchant guild contract, apparently this unfortunate trade convoy from Thane’s Hold was turned back by agents of House Meria. By nightfall they reach the entrance to a cave mouth that was marked on their contract map, and they engage a band of goblin warriors camped in front. After ambushing them and finding they bear the mark of “The Red Hand”, they lay in wait for any stragglers outside the cave entrance. Slaying the orc boss and the remaining goblins, our party slowly enters the small dark cavern guided by the light of their darkvision, torches, and light enchanted rocks. Choosing to head down the eastern path they delve deep under the earth eventually emerging into a sizable natural cavern. Inside they ambush and awaken a pack of bugbears who they handily defeat. Here they discover stored caches of weapons, food, medicine, an assortment of raw ore, as well as ammunition and gathered loot. Hearing only the dripping echo of the deep underground pool at the center of the cave chamber, our party pauses in the depth of night to plot their next moves…


CHAPTER III “MERIA’S CODE”
1111.1AE
Level 3
As the fellowship catches their breath in the darkness of the cave, their aasimar paladin suddenly drops into a meditative position and vanishes in a *blip* of sparkling blue light…little do they know that he was teleported into the Outlands of the planes meeting a vision from Leviathan as he now swears an oath of vengeance. Before setting out further, their human paladin steels himself and takes an oath of ancients, the wood elf rogue adopts the cunning mantle of mastermind, and the dragonborn fully unlocks his Bushido fighting spirit. Unsure of what just transpired, the group decides to double back up the rotten ladder and back to the main forked path near the entrance of the cave. As they head down the left path they come to a curved earthen-hewn staircase and spot dim light ahead. As their rogue stealthily scouts ahead they spot a goblin camp of dark-skinned brutes led by what appears to be a goblin shaman with a bone and feather headdress. Attracting the party with Orish mimic-speech, they quickly slaughter the group using a well-placed smoke bomb in the choke point at the top of the stairs. The shaman flees deeper into the cavern after exhausting his illusory magic and veil of fog, dying to an arrow at the last moment as he unleashes a caged troll. The hobbled and mutated beast rushes them only to be cut down by well placed sword strikes and seared to a crisp by magical flames. Before the beast’s cut limbs can attempt to regenerate they are cast into the flames… The party searches the cavern and discovers more weapons, armaments, heirloom art, and potential magical orcish artifacts. In a makeshift dungeon at the back of the cave they find 3 prisoners, 2 slain humans and a barely surviving elf whom they release, a ranger named FERIN. He recounts they were part of the second mercenary party sent from MERIA to slay the goblin leader but were ambushed and captured, he being the sole survivor after a week of torture at the beasts’ hand. During this time the rogue finally learns the Orc language and begins to decipher the books and scrolls they have gathered: some seem to be rough poetry stanzas potentially denoting spell scrolls, others are direct orders to slay and loot trade caravans sealed with the red handed signatures of UGLUK THE RED and his hobgoblin lieutenant GAUOREZZ NIGHTSTALKER. On one of the scrolls 3 symbolic orc ciphers appear, one potentially denoting the 3 trees and boulder of this very cavern along with two others, showing a skull with X symbols and another a lone spire with two circles. Fearing to camp anywhere near the cave the party sallies forth and makes for THE NORTH ROAD. As they cross the desolate GRAY HILLS as dawn rises, they are ambushed by more dragonborn ninja of THE GOLDEN ORDER who apparently had been tracking them. On their scrolls sealed with the sign of Tiamat, they learn that the dragonborn samurai has a 999 gold piece bounty on his head. After weathering their alchemical grenades and an attempted smoke bomb retreat, they slay all three. Exhausted and bloodied from the night of danger, FERIN finds a suitable campsite and they finally take a much needed day of rest. The next day they travel uneventfully down the road camping again without incident. The next day they come across a guarded caravan from THANE’S HOLD headed to MERIA captained by BRAX BJORNSON, whom they decided to join after some hearty greetings and a game of dice. After bartering their services as escorts in exchange for information, the party heads on the 2 day journey back to MERIA. Along the way they enjoy the hospitality of dwarven fire whiskey and roasted mutton, learning more about the current beleaguered battlelines of THE GRAY GATE. The aasimar paladin reveals his potential claim to the throne of DARGO, as well as his past assignment in THANE’S HOLD where he learned dwarven with a paramour there. BRAX takes a noticed interest in this and offers the paladin his personal seal of THANE’S MERCHANT GUILD, telling him to meet him in 1 week’s time at the GILDED CREST tavern outside the dwarven guild embassy in MERIA. The dwarf merchant probes the adventurers and asks them where their loyalties may ultimately lie in the coming months…
They arrive at the outskirts of MERIA and settle in for the night at the rough RUSTY AXLE tavern and brothel. They mark the increased MERIA guard patrols walking the city limits. They retire to their rooms for the night, but not before the meditating dragonborn samurai overhears an outrider come in from THE GRAY WASTES share with the barkeep that the situation at THE GRAY GATE is dire, with GATE COMMANDER SAPENTUS apparently making a last stand under siege by THE RED HORDE with his men. When asked, the gray and grizzled ranger would give no more information other than the fact that he had encountered dragonborn before as he disappeared into the night. The next day the wagon party enters the main gate of MERIA where BRAX craftily bribes a gate guard as he shows his merchant guild writ to account for his increased escort. The city is abuzz and much more tense since they departed, with regiments of MERIA soldiers in full force in the streets. BRAX and his men bid farewell as the party enters THE LAUGHING DRAGON to find the bar chock full of pirates, brigands, and olive-skinned sailors drinking to a raucous band of exotic drummers. GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS lazily lounges on stage smoking his pipe as the dragonborn tips him again. The party sits at the bar to get the attention of the silver dwarf innkeeper YARIN, second-in-command to BRORNOR, who fetches his boss. BRORNOR, looking mighty weary, happily greets the fellowship and invites them back to his private office at the back of the tavern where he does business. After inspecting the goblin shaman circlet and counting the goblin and orc ears taken, he decides to up their payment to sixty gold pieces each for a contract well executed. When asked, he also reticently mentions he has a troubled past with BRAX. Concluding their business he eyes the party markedly and shares with them the dire political news from the week past…
The sad word on the mouths of the mounted couriers is that HOUSE AETHERIUS has not sent any reinforcements to the front at THE GRAY GATE. HOUSE MERIA has sent several regiments to reinforce and hopefully break the lines of THE RED HORDE, with a new battalion being mustered in the city as they speak. BRORNOR shares that although he likes the party, he has been forbidden by OREON and the other guild lords to offer any mercenary contracts other than those that directly reinforce the frontline at THE GATE. He laments that this is the only work he can offer sellswords such as they are, and fears they may not return if they embark with the MERIA forces. With some candor he sizes up the fellowship and asks where their loyalty will lie in the coming conflicts. He senses that the battle in the north is but the opening move in a brewing total war between the great houses and lesser forces in AETERNUM in this new era of chaos…


CHAPTER IV “ROAD TO THE WOOD”
Last days of 1111.1AE
Level 4
Our party decides to stay the week in MERIA at THE LAUGHING DRAGON after voting to not join the departing battalion of over 1,000 Meria soldiers headed to reinforce THE GRAY GATE. In dreams and visions leading up to arriving in the city Ulrick is warned by Silvanus that if he seeks to satisfy his revenge for his family, it could lead him down a dark path. Zadshen similarly receives a vision from Leviathan during his mysterious planar disappearance showing clues about the first fallen angel leading into the FELLWOOD. Shorea dreams of Bahamut urging him to release the bound demon of rage he mysteriously harbors. En route to the city the day before, Nynora sees a hawk drop a scroll in view of her just like the missives her father used to receive from ‘W’.... 
The party decides to await Zadshen’s planned meeting with BRAX in one week. They are introduced to BRORNOR’s guild contacts in order to make their required trading, the Laughing Dragon resident blacksmith ORNN, and a mysterious elf in the trade quarter of the city, “THE FENCE”. Here they sold most of their loot for a sizable payday, trading some of it in for new armor and masterwork weapons. The three black iron rings of constitution and the amulet of lesser protection they kept for themselves. 
During this week in the capital Ulrick enjoys seeing the ocean for the first time and prays for a vision from Silvanus, realizing that now he is being called back to his home in THE FELLWOOD after sending a carrier sparrow to Thalindra who bids him return to his home village of OAKENLEAF. Arca busies himself with seeking out other acolytes of Alaya within the city and gets a lead on one of the oracles’ ashes and sacred burial artifacts being kept in THE TOWER OF DUSK by mages of HOUSE AETHERIUS. Shorea asks around the tavern for news of any dragonborn and hears that his elder senpai YURIO ZARASHI has been sighted in DARGO seeking to duel the knights there. Nynora disguises herself and enters the MERIA great library where she bonds with ARCHIVIST BELVAS who helps her research the two letters from ‘W’ she has received. The second one, written in Draconic, was a coded cipher that warns “Nejune moves against Dargo on the Blood Moon”, a celestial ritual event occurring in two months time. Zadshen headed to the MERIA guildhall HQ on an isle in the port district and asked around the ambassadors there for any access to OREON himself and also in relation to the current war. He learned that no one gets meetings with the guild lords until they are the highest ranking mercenaries, and also that most soldiers believed the situation at THE GRAY GATE was spiraling fast.
After meeting with BRAX, Zadshen received an offer asking him and his companions to come live in THANE’S HOLD as sworn guards of THE MERCHANT GUILD if the keep closes its gates in the coming war. The price was eleven thousand gold pieces per year, potentially lasting up to a decade as the dwarves close their heavily fortified upper gates to THE GRAY WASTES and their lower gates leading into THE UNDERDARK hoping to wait out THE RED HORDE’S onslaught.
The party decided many of their goals align with heading south in THE FELLWOOD to return to Ulrick’s home village of OAKENLEAF where his mentor THALINDRA was asking for him. Zadshen also hoped to gain more clues about his quarry there. Arca spoke happily of his connections with THE BLESSED OF ALAYA having been trained and blessed by MISTRAYA herself. On the road they handily slew a crew of bandits demanding a toll bearing the mark of THE BLACK GULLS. During the battle Shorea goes on a killing spree and seems shaken by the battle, freezing and seemingly retreating within himself in conflict… They headed south into the forest and began following a rushing creek running parallel to the road. The party then came upon a forest gnome caravan guarded by elves of THE FELLWOOD WATCH buying some trinkets from them and asking about their goals. During the night's watch they spot a pack of dire wolves seemingly following them. Following the creek south into a crystal clear lake, they camp where Nynora and Ulrick disappear in the night…
The next day Zadshen, Shorea, and Arca decided to follow the monstrous tracks found near the lake hoping to hunt some of the hobgoblin cutthroat bands sent by THE RED HORDE to apparently parlay with the forest tribes of orcs to secure an alliance. They discover the tracks are those of a centaur band, though they eventually lead them to the midst of a battle between the dire wolf pack and a scouting party of hobgoblins. They assist the wolves in slaying the scouts, who do not attack them outright, and then hear the sounding war horn of another scouting party. They defeat this party as well, even healing multiple of the wolves back from near death including the alpha of the pack. A silent gaze of understanding passes between the aggressive wolf pack and the hunters, who back away slowly from their kills. The three heroes double back on the trail they found and continue on…



CHAPTER V “MEMORIES OF OAKENLEAF”
1111.2AE
Level 5
After departing the battlefield in the forest meadow backing away from the wolfpack, Zad, Sho, and Arca re-meet up with Ulrick further north. He explains that he and Nynora had gone to help an elven child find their lost rabbit Thumper and ended up speaking with a tree spirit, solving a riddle, and later finding a lost cache of gold and gems. Nynora, he said, determined to go rogue, has ventured alone into the forest intent on picking up on the trail of her mentor. Ulrick, wanting to make all haste back to his home village of Oakenleaf, led the group south-southwest along the road. As they force marched through the night, they came upon the lone camp of the tiefling druid Vonda, who had been sent by her mentor FAYRUS THE GREEN to study the magical blight affecting the forest. Vonda mentions that AENARION and FAYRUS are leading a vanguard of hunters in the north of the Fellwood to track down and slay all of the encroaching hobgoblin parties bearing the red hand. She traded with the party, shared some local herbal lore, and then departed to continue her survey and study. Later on the road they find corpses hanging from an old wooden watch platform and sense the taint of dark magic there. Assuming NEJUNE to be at work here, they quickly burn the dark site. The adventurers continued south moving off the main road onto a rougher path known to Ulrick that led to his home. Along the path they slew a terrible shambling mound laying in wait for its prey over a pit of dead foliage and bones. In the plant beast’s pit they discover several valuable undigested suits of armor. Some miles ahead they later discover an abandoned outpost, ransacked and emptied, with its inhabitants piled dead in a clearing. As they approach a wicked vampire spawn attacks, raising the small horde of zombies to overwhelm the party. Using divine magic and blinding steel, they crush the undead and discover that the whole outpost has been raided beforehand not 2 days ago. They find a burnt letter from FELLWOOD WATCH urging all small outposts and villages in the forest to abandon their undefended territories and make for the fortress. After making camp for their first night of full rest in 2 days, they awaken at dawn to the piercing cries of WATCH eagle riders soaring overhead flying due west. The night before when attempting to contact Silvanus in ritual, Ulrick senses a shadowy veil over his ability to pray successfully. During his night watch, Shorea stumbles for a moment feeling the water in his gourd seemingly boiling as Bahamut speaks in his mind warning that the demon of rage is not in him, but in his liquid sword. Zadshen spends a moment confused as he senses Leviathan’s presence, and gets a ping of a location in his mind around 200 hundred miles away to the east. Continuing down the trail they enter a wooded valley where elven riders from the Watch are also making for OAKENLEAF. They meet and trade with them, agreeing to accompany them to the village when they hear the ill news of the morning that THE GRAY GATE burns, and its defenders have fallen. They whisper that eagle riders sent by AENARION himself witnessed the fortress aflame from high altitude, and SAPENTUS and all the men from AETHERIUS, MERIA, and the WATCH are presumed dead. They arrive at Ulrick’s home village to a somber site, with many of the villagers packing their goods into barrels, bags, and carts. The elven riders mention they have been sent here to help the village prepare for an exodus to the east, seeing as more and more undead have been sighted in the southern woods. Ulrick rushes to the tent of the elders where BERUUS, the wizened half-orc chief and the other sages are gathered around a bedridden THALINDRA. Ulrick learns that she and some of the others in the village have taken on a dark illness that chills the bones and saps vitality, not responding to any magical or herbal healing. She shares with the party all that has passed since her young pupil has left the village, with a war brewing now between HOUSE NEJUNE and the allied forces of THE FELLWOOD. With the hobgoblin commandos of THE RED HORDE recruiting from the north, and now more sightings of the undead in the south, she believes NEJUNE is now making their move to blight the forest and attack the free peoples there. It is assumed that HOUSE NEJUNE ultimately wishes to end the line of HOUSE DARGO and install their own puppet nobility there. Others believe that the dark magicians of NEJUNE seek to complete their age-old destruction of the Moon Elves of ALAYA’S REST and seek to contest and even control all the southern magic sites within the FELLWOOD. When asked about the blood moon in 2 months on 1111.4AE, she fears that the three great magical powers of AETERNUM will harness the wild winds of magic that night in their grand rituals to their own ends: NEJUNE for destruction, AETHERIUS for knowledge, and BLESSED OF ALAYA for ascension. She also spoke of a great Council to be held at FELLWOOD WATCH in one week’s time, where AENARION has called all leaders of the woodland realms, including MISTRAYA, to meet and decide how they should approach the coming war. It is rumored that MISTRAYA herself will meet the council, though she will not abandon the blessed Springs of Alaya that make up the core of ALAYA’S REST. It is rumored that she indeed [along with FAYRUS THE GREEN] is the oldest elf alive on AETERNUM, and is potentially even immortal. Some say she parlays with the planes and even seeks to attain demi-godhood by becoming the Avatar of Alaya. AENARION has sent out riders to convince and gather all small villages and outposts to make for the safety of the walls at the WATCH. Ulrick, asked by his mentor herself, adeptly convinces the stubborn Beruus and the other elders to gather the village to depart with the riders sent for the WATCH. Thalindra warns him that she will die soon, and has accepted this fate, passing all her magic, items, and destiny onto the hero of Oakenleaf. The party has much to ponder as they hear all this and retire to the local inn, and are given four horses as a gift from the village. Ulrick is invited to stay up in an all-night vigil and ritual to Silvanus with Thalindra which magically enhances his prized amulet and charges it with even more lightning power. Shorea and Zadshen attempt to interrogate the town drunk who claims to have been the first to be blighted, and mumbles something about the power of the NEJUNE artifacts. Arca sits in silent prayer that night and breaks through to a vision of the radiant goddess Alaya, who warns him that all elves must leave AETERNUM before its potential destruction. The next morning they quickly sell off their excess weapons and armor to the local merchants, and ride together planning to quickly make for ALAYA’S REST and accompany the caravan with MISTRAYA all the way to FELLWOOD WATCH. Zadshen also inquires about bonding a wild beast to him with the local beastmaster Wotann. Entering a clearing later that day, they found signs of battle with multiple elves dead among the tall grass. Crouched and in tattered clothes, 2 feral-looking humans watch them across the meadow. As the mounted party approaches they roar with terrible power and transform, revealing themselves as cursed werebears. They party unleashes all their magical and martial might to slay the beasts, but not before Zadshen narrowly avoids being cursed himself from a terrible bite. The party double checks their saddles and steels their wills, preparing for the perilous journey ahead…


CHAPTER VI “DEATH IN THE DARK”
1111.2AE
Level 6
The party continues west along the path in the forest making speed towards ALAYA’S REST as Zadshen has another vision of Leviathan and rides off solo into the woods. The group decides to make haste through the night, force marching until they come upon a campfire ahead off the path. They encounter the lesser noble wizard of NEJUNE Trimenius and his two guardsmen hunting for his escaped halfling slaves. After some tense words, Ulrick and Shorea are enraged by the elf’s disdain for life after he offers to pay them to recapture his property and slay him and one of his guards in fury. The other guard they knock-out and tie to a tree before interrogating him. He is a NEJUNE-born human named Varn who tells them very little, though he does surmise the magical blight in the FELLWOOD was intentionally created by the mages of NEJUNE. They release him with some rations and his weapons, begrudgingly getting his thanks for sparing his life as he now somehow hopes to survive the journey to MERIA; the only place a failed NEJUNE sellsword could hope to now find work. Traveling until dawn, the party of three make a short camp and head onward exhausted now by their forced march on horseback. Down the road and in the sparser forest they hear branches snapping and are ambushed by a hungry pack of feasting ghouls. Shorea is paralyzed by poison claws of the first ghoul, while Arca and Ulrick desperately try to slay the others as their hunger descends furiously on the helpless dragonborn. They smite the evil husks and are forced to heal the grave wounds Sho suffered before continuing further on to make safe camp near a small forest pond. Sho then again battles with the will of the demon in Glaw but this time is assisted by a mystic vision of Bahamut in human form, cloaked in white silks and wielding his legendary dai-katana urging him to seek MISTRAYA in order to cleanse the blade. During their night watch, Arca shares his experience training with the BLESSED OF ALAYA over 10 years ago, and how he fears that MISTRAYA will never abandon her conclave and the sacred springs they protect. He asks for their help at the coming council to convince her and her moon elf oracles to heed caution. At dawn Zadshen returns to the party on horseback, sharing he had visions from Leviathan giving updated information on the fallen angels whereabouts. Heading out for the day, the heroes can begin to see the far away ocean from the tops of hills as a great storm brews to the west. They also use their spyglass to spot a great flock of harpies flying in the distance. As the group head even further downhill on the forested slopes moving west they spot the elven caravan leaving ALAYA’S REST up ahead. They meet with MISTRAYA’S guard captain PHERIEN who assigns them to the rear guard in the group as they speak with the soldiers there. As they watch the 2 eagle rider scouts circle the party in the overcast sky above they hear the fell news that THANE’S HOLD is now under full siege by THE RED HORDE. The whispers are that if the mountain’s upper gates are besieged as well as the lower gates leading to the Underdark, the dwarven kingdom could really be in grave danger if they do not receive military aid. They also share news on the road of the Blightrot now affecting multiple village communities in the FELLWOOD, slowly killing those that contract the magical disease. The fear is that a grand ritual cast by HOUSE NEJUNE could be responsible for the disease of both people and trees, and perhaps killing the primary caster could end it. They also hear that HOUSE AETHERIUS representatives will be at the council as well, whom they eagerly await a decision from regarding their neutral alliance with THE FELLWOOD WATCH. It is also known that AETHERIUS’s economy is largely enriched by the lucrative trade with the dwarves, and so if THANE’S HOLD were to fall it would create a cascading monetary and political chaos among the great houses. Traveling at good speed east along the road, the only thing reported by the eagle riders is a horde of zombies some miles away in the deep forest. They make camp at a small sheltered cave mouth for the night, with the heroes being assigned bedding on top of the cave’s boulders. Mistraya addresses the group and thanks them, reiterating to keep their guard up and how important this mission is. Her boisterous protege ELDRATHA speaks directly to the heroes and asks their true intentions for being here, making sure they are taking this seriously before she retires to the oracle’s tent. Mistraya then casts a sphere of silence over the campsite, instructing Pherien to have no less than half the guard squad of 20 to be keeping watch at all times. The party go through the first watch without incident, noticing only the starlight and relaxed banter of some of the veteran elves and men. Sho dreams again of the Bahamut and the demon of rage subtly vying for power though he feels benevolently shielded somehow from it all. Arca and Sho are awakened from restless sleep late in the dead of night to the whistling sounds of what sound like loosed arrows as they wake Ulrick and Zadshen. As they rouse from sleep they see multiple guards sprint into the black of the forest, and before they can follow them another guard grabs their arm and whispers to act natural as they have reported an enemy scout around the perimeter. Not a second later they see 3 red sparks glowingly emerge from the tree line, as three wands of fireball erupt into the campsite instantly killing several guards and burning one of the tied great eagles alive in the deafening explosions. Mistraya and Eldratha are seen briefly by Ulrick magically shielding one of the fireballs as it consumed their tent and they are thrown backwards. In a booming magical voice they then hear BOREAS THE OX call for MISTRAYA’S head under the “Law of Bane” presenting the writ of assassination publicly from the tree line, claiming per the legal writ that all but her who lay down their arms will be spared. Enraged, Zadshen sprouts glowing angelic wings and shouts to BOREAS taunting him as Shorea draws Glaw and roars. Before they can react they hear the clicks of crossbows as multiple poison bolts soar in and kill most of the remaining FELLWOOD WATCH guards near the campfire as simultaneously globes of darkness magically blind the heroes where they stand. Hearing the shouts of allies, the screams of pain, and the clashing of steel within the magical darkness, the heroes desperately try to orient themselves in the chaos of the battle, feeling the sickening gut instinct that they are surrounded and doomed. Ulrick manages to use locate object to hone in on MISTRAYA’s Robes of Alaya and correctly runs towards the brush where her and ELDRATHA are lying. He witnesses a furious exchange from the legendary oracle to Eldratha in an ancient moon elf dialect before Mistraya turns to him and demands he willingly come with her through a teleportation portal to escape the battle, telling him it is either this or death. Torn due to his loyalty to his companions he ultimately agrees as she grabs his wrist and they disappear through a silvery portal. Eldratha then runs towards the other heroes as they battle 2 assassins valiantly, then attracting the attention of BOREAS and his hit squad in pursuit. PHERIEN then appears bloodied from the treeline and offers support with his longbow, killing one of the nearest foes. Another globe of darkness cast by the pursuing BOREAS covers Eldratha and the party, just as the remaining nearby assassin deftly tackles her to the ground and covers her mouth and pins her wrist in a desperate maneuver as she shouts to the others to come to her. As the shadow monks and dusk warriors of FORT BANE close in on the prized oracle they try everything to stop her escaping. They show their bloodlust by chucking acidic grenades onto her position and unleashing a Ki blast of searing flame gravely wounding Eldratha & the heroes and outright killing the man holding her down. Using their intelligence and calling to each other using their voices, the heroes link arms and move towards Eldratha in the dark as she narrowly joins her hands and blinks them out of the battle with a silvery shimmer. The heroes arrive seconds later bloody and bruised on their backs, staring up at the moon in the center of a great waystone circle just a mile outside the fort of FELLWOOD WATCH. They see a few other soldiers there waiting for them as Mistraya and Eldratha run towards one another, the latter enraged and cursing in elvish. Mistraya explains briefly that all those men she left behind had willingly offered their lives in sacrifice to the Prophecy of Alaya, as she had apparently seen this night before in her divination and had to force the assassin's hand. Eldratha, knowing this, still showed her outward rage as tears filled her eyes. Mistraya thanks the heroes and said this could not be avoided to pursue the timeline chosen and revealed to her by Alaya, leaving and telling the party she would see them at the council where they could speak more.. Bewildered and stunned, Arca and Ulrick start teary prayers as Zadshen and Shorea collect their shell shocked wits. Ulrick, in a aching bid to Silvanus, prays for more strength and a sign to make sense of the growing darkness welling within him. Escorted by members of the Watch, they are greeted with solemn eyes as they approach the fort town in the middle of the night seeing streams of refugees bringing the city to life. They enter a rough makeshift inn and are given room and board. Arca in his rage and grief, prepared to even give his life earlier in defense of Mistraya, is seen headed straight for his room to pray. Ulrick is brought over by Sho and Zadshen to have a much needed stein of ale and gather information from the packed tavern. Ulrick, confused and still seeking revenge for his family, seeks the company of a green tiefling warlock at the bar called Drell to learn about the arcane. He shares with him over another beer that he is in a magical pact with the king of The Feywild, Oberon, and to come seek him for more information after the Council meeting. Shorea asks around after getting quickly drunk to learn about the anti-magic gear needed to enter and hunt down NEJUNE mages. Zadshen learns about how the fortified town will soon be out of lodging and potentially even basic supplies for the thousands of refugees now streaming into it. The party beds down for the night with many questions unanswered as they now await THE COUNCIL OF THE WOOD….

ACT II: HEROIC AWAKENING
CHAPTER VII “THE COUNCIL OF THE WOOD”
1111.2AE
Level 7
The adventurers awaken to the charged crowds of FELLWOOD WATCH awaiting the COUNCIL OF THE WOOD. They make preparations doing some trading with a local nomadic dwarf before gathering with the throngs at the main council moot site at the center of the city. The COUNCIL opens with a blessing to ALAYA from MISTRAYA before AENARION and FAYRUS give their opening addresses urging the houses present to hear each other out and unite to face to oncoming siege of the RED HORDE as well as secure the FELLWOOD against the encroaching blight and forces of the undead. Various village elders from the FELLWOOD are present, including BERUUS from OAKENLEAF who had successfully evacuated his people to the fort. Present from THANE’S HOLD is LIONEL BLACKPEBBLE who pleads for help to lift the siege of his people, he scoffs at the inaction in the north to defend the dwarves. It is revealed that the fall of the GRAY GATE was largely due to the giant king TAUREN ROCKBREAKER and his overwhelming siege army. From MERIA is GROMWINSTON THE GARRULOUS who shares that their outlying farmlands and villages are now making for the city walls and also sending refugees to other major cities; he claims OREON has sent him saying HOUSE MERIA cannot commit more troops or fleets to aid the dwarves as their advance would be treacherous. Due to the siege giants and war engines of the HORDE, approaching their backline either from the ground or from the sea would spell heavy casualties. MERIA’S expeditionary fleet in the northern sea suffered heavy losses of galleons to the storm siege giants. The fear is that if the dwarves hold falls, the next logical target with the most vulnerability would be the outlying settlements and city of MERIA itself. There is now an economic and refugee crisis as the peoples of MERIA and the FELLWOOD seek new homes in AETHERIUS, as all trade caravans in the GRAY WASTES have ceased. From AETHERIUS is LORD TARTULIEN who assures the council that HOUSE AETHERIUS is now fortifying THE TOWER OF DUSK as a bulwark against further advances south from the HORDE, and also laments that they cannot commit forces to aid in the north at this time due to the constant attacks suffered in THE GRAY WASTES. Many in the crowd speak with hushed disdain for HOUSE AETHERIUS as they did not commit reinforcements to the fall of the GRAY GATE. When TARTULIEN insults SAPENTUS for his failure at the GATE, Sho cries out in solidarity for the fallen commander, which some of the crowd cheers on. From DARGO is LADY MERA who proclaims her people’s fleets stand ready but will not risk sailing north at this time. From NEJUNE are three unknown hooded half-orc mages who reiterate the neutrality and isolationist stance of their liege MAGUS GOR. The crowd boos and hisses at the mention and denial of NEJUNE being the source of the undead and blight menace. AENARION urges the forces present to secure their borders and also work together in the coming conflicts, though no great coalition or joint action is agreed upon. ZADSHEN rises and gives a rousing speech proclaiming his will and the need for the great houses to unite against evil. AENARION and MISTRAYA then invite the heroes back to THE FELLWOOD HUNTER’S LODGE to speak in private as the great masses erupt into chaos and gossip as the council disbands. As they leave LADY MERA tells ZADSHEN to seek her in DARGO after denying his wish that she join them in open conflict against NEJUNE, citing the treaties already in place. They also speak with LIONEL who honors their bravery speaking up at the council, and tells them over an ale that the last resort for the dwarves is a fighting exodus into the UNDERDARK as they detonate the death runes collapsing their beloved home, as even in their desperation they have even awakened the ancient rune golems to defend their halls. Back in the sanctum of the LODGE, MISTRAYA welcomes them and thanks them for their defense of her force during the assassination attempt and asks them what they believe the “Mist” to truly be. AENARION recognizes the party and asks them “who do you believe the real enemy is?” They reveal from the Prophecy of Alaya that they know the mist is unnatural and created for reasons unknown. Whether to keep the continent isolated and protected from something outside in the world or to trap and keep the peoples of AETERNUM in solitude. MISTRAYA and FAYRUS are old enough to recall the days centuries ago [over 300 years now] before the mist was laid but speak cryptically. THE INQUISITION has seen to the destruction of all records and mentions of the “pre-mist” times. They also reveal that yes, MISTRAYA is seeking to become the Avatar of Alaya, and that they fear the reason for UGLUK THE RED’S true power and rise at this time is that he has already become The Avatar of Bel’Mog. The battle indeed on the Material Plane here and now is being mirrored among the Outer Planes. They suspect AETHERIUS when the party questions them but remind them of the oath and treaty of neutrality they hold with them, saying they cannot move against them as their people rely on their trade. They also learn of the terrible ancient foe of the FELLWOOD, VISSIGERON THE CRUEL. The elder green dragon’s lair is unknown, though they fear he and his minions are afoot in the plots against them. They do see NEJUNE as an enemy and task the party with infiltrating their lands to end the source of the blight, believed to be cast from a great ritual cabal of mages. They need to end the blight before it spirals out of control due the winds of magic influence coming in mere weeks upon the blood moon on 1111.4AE. The party swears their service in exchange for select items from the FELLWOOD WATCH armory, gaining boots of elvenkind as well as some magical weapons and armor. The party also purchases a wand of fireball and a wand of web at a premium price. Trusted elves of the Watch are assigned to them on their travels west, ZARTH and CELIOS. MISTRAYA, sensing the demon in his sword, shares prophetically to Sho that he will meet dragonborne brethren soon, and also that a time is coming when he will have to choose between the cursed blade and his own life. ULRICK finds the warlock DRELL at a local bar again and asks about how to make a pact with THE FEY to become a warlock; he is tasked with finding his master, a halfling warlock ELLYRIA in the eastern village of ASHEN FIELD. MISTRYA then summons the party to perform a great ritual to ALAYA at the temple, greatly strengthening their radiant spells and weapons against the undead and fiends, and also granting Sho resistance to necrotic damage for 1 month. During the ritual Sho is transported into an ethereal battle with the DEMON OF RAGE at the memory site of his village burning; he wins by submitting the fiend in single combat. The next day ZADSHEN finds beastmaster WOTANN and performs a ritual with him in the wood to transform his divine prayer Find Steed to summon a celestial dire wolf instead. The party, newly equipped and given fresh steeds, set out along the road. A few days down the road west they encounter a heavily reinforced NEJUNE trade caravan interrogating a smaller wood elf caravan accusing them of ruining a recent trade deal and also stealing some of their goods. The party is enraged and try to intimidate and talk down the confrontation, but to no avail as the NEJUNE traders are intent on using the neutral law of the road to take the elves back to face trial in their lands. Zarth cautions the party against open hostilities that could set off an excuse for open war between NEJUNE and THE FELLWOOD. After some heated words and displays of strength, the wood elves tearfully confess to their thievery and the party moves on. Further down the road they come upon slain NEJUNE traders and encounter a terrible Boneclaw revenant, a failed lich creation lurking nearby. They slay the undead beast but not before it outright kills Sho’s horse. ZARTH and CELIOS fear the worst as this level of undead has not been seen for decades this far into the eastern woods. Moving further down the road in an icy storm of sleet and rain, they move to make camp at the small village of SILVER CREEK. They spot flocks and crows and buzzards circling ominous overhead and CELIOS wild shapes into vulture form to scout ahead. He laments that the village has been destroyed and is now patrolled by dangerous packs of undead wights, thus the party rides into the night before camping further west. Along the road the next day they encounter an elderly robed man sitting alone by his fire, who they question to no avail. The cryptic old human merely walks alone into the forest not wishing to reveal anything about himself, NEJUNE, or the blight. Later at camp ULRICK makes a prayer to SILVANUS and is unable to connect, but fears internally that if he chooses the warlock path he would have to choose between his old god and his new patron. The next day they encounter a small forest gnome caravan atop ponies who they trade with to acquire some questionable potions of magic resist and madcap mushrooms. Further downhill the wooded road they meet a group of dwarven slaves, escaped captive miners formerly under the whip of BLACK FANG. They share they are oathbreakers who left THANE’S HOLD long ago and have been escaping their captors for weeks scrounging out an existence running into the FELLWOOD; the party offers them some coin and rations and wishes them luck. As they near the western edge of the forest the party sees more and more signs of blight, rotted trees spotted with black veins and sickly gray woodland creatures who have died from blightrot whose forms do not decompose due to their magical corruption. On the path hours later ZARTH and CELIOS suddenly freeze wide-eyed and break into a cold sweat, regaining composure sharing that they were just attacked via psychic will. The party draws their weapons as a green shimmering portal opens in a nearby tree revealing a black armorclad fey who introduces himself as LORD IRELLION as he nimbly dodges URLICK’S wand of fireball. The Fey Noble claims he serves VISSIGERON and bids the party sweetly to abandon their quest and turn back to the north. IRELLION tries to convince them of his master’s will by invoking the rebalancing of life and death within the forest. He manages to charm ARCA and SHO with his magical gaze, as ZADSHEN resists under his protection from good and evil spell along with ULRICK. Despite their magically misplaced trust from some of their party, ZARTH bids them make no deal with the fey, as ULRICK angrily asks what he truly wants. He speaks in riddles, but ultimately offers him the power he hungrily seeks in exchange for departing with him to the plane of THE FEYWILD. ULRICK refuses, realizing the Fey Lord has been watching them in the wood as he shares his master’s wish to allow the blight to “rebalance” the forest and reclaim it as his rightful domain. They turn down the fey as he disappears into the tree portal. The heroes gather their wits and speed to gallop along the muddy road southwest now approaching within a day’s ride to THE TOMB OF SAINT BEL’RAA…


CHAPTER VIII “THE TOMB OF BEL’RAA”
1111.2AE
Level 8
The party camps for the night and makes preparations for travel ahead. In the twilight of their camp, SHO notices ULRICK go off alone into the woods. In the night, SHO dreams of the demon of rage bidding him to serve him to gain power. ULRICK dreams of a withering tree of SILVANUS with a scheming OBERON now holding an orb containing his essence. ZADSHEN dreams of LEVIATHAN speaking draconic to him and showing one of his fallen angelic guardians now captive in a force cage in the TOWER OF DUSK. SHO translates the draconic message the next morning as saying “Aetherius……collecting….binding….”  The next day CELIOS and ZARTH scout ahead and rendezvous with a scout of the FELLWOOD WATCH as he travels south to NEJUNE miles away in the forest. They bring his intel of the movements in the rest of the world: MERIA is now in an economic battle with AETHERIUS as tensions rise with the end of land trade to THANE’S HOLD and the increase of sea trade between MERIA and DARGO. AETHERIUS now faces an economic crisis as they smelt new gold to build their war chest. No word has been heard from the dwarves. MERIA has also apparently sent a small, secret fleet to negotiate an alliance with the lords of NEJUNE to form a power block against the existing alliance between AETHERIUS and DARGO. In the lands of NEJUNE there have been reports of increased slave rebellions. TARIS and BEREN have moved the bulk of their forces north to fortify their battlements in and around the TOWER OF DUSK. While the DARGO military musters for war, the nobles of their house are rumored to be steeped in fresh plots of intrigue.
As ZARTH and CELIOS bid the party farewell, they give over a letter from MISTRAYA showing the detailed location for the TOMB OF BEL’RAA as well as the moon elven incantation to reveal its secret entrance. Approaching along the fields west of the FELLWOOD, the party spies hoards of flying harpies far to the north, lands known to house monstrous nests of dangerous beasts that increase as one approaches the ancient temple site of MAGUS RISE to the northwest. The party travels a halfday to a ring of tree surrounding a massive rune-encrusted granite stone and speaks the spell to reveal the silverine secret door. Upon opening the door they discover the first of many necrotic trap sigils which sap life. They enter the tomb to find an altar of ALAYA desecrated with black eldritch runes etched in a forgotten language presumably from ancient NEJUNE. As they clear the bones from the water pool they are attacked by a group of ghosts. ZADSHEN’S celestial wolf succumbs to death in the battle. Filling the basin with water, they perform a ritual using the ground silver from ZAD’s javelin to create a few gallons of holy water, though ARCA cautions against using the altar to divine, citing the curse upon the tomb. A black wind blows across them a moment later as SHO succumbs to magical exhaustion. They discover journals of former tomb robbers on their skeletons explaining the ancient battle between life and death embodied by HERONIMUS and ALAYA after she ascended to godhood. Traveling down a long hallway they see ancient paintings of the quests of ALAYA and her apostles as she overcame trials of death, fear, and decay. They set off multiple necrotic rune traps as they use detect magic and their wits to identify the others in a large room filled with altars and a large reliquary. In the corner a mound of armed skeleton warriors are piled which activate as they attempt to open a small hatch on the reliquary basin unleashing an angry shadow fiend. Using all of their magical and marital might, they manage to defeat the fiend and the ancient skeletal warriors smiting and turning the undead in a battle that almost saw ULRICK slain. During a short rest they spot a skulking bodak and ULRICK unleashes one of his new fey pact abilities feeblemind, which shatters the mind of the undead beast. The spell unleashes wild magic that supercharges the hex while also blinding the party with a brilliant spray of color. After slaying the creature and recovering its black soul gem where they can sense the fallen wizard’s malice, they decide to venture into the crawlspace entering the actual tomb containing SAINT BEL’RAA. Inside they sense great evil and find themselves choking on poison gas as the spectre of MALDRAK THE BLACKENED appears revealing himself as the shadowy green skull of a demilich cursing the tomb. In a titanic battle they face down this evil using all the remaining power they possess. SHO is cursed in the duel, ULRICK is laid low, ZAD becomes paralyzed by its ethereal scream, and ARCA nearly dies heroically using his holy magic to break the lich. SHO steels himself as the demon in his swords beckons him to use its power to avoid death, which he refuses. In a final gambit, ULRIC is revived by ZADSHEN’S lay on hands and manages to destroy the demilch’s physical skull form casting moonbeam. ARCA witnesses MALDRAK’S shadowy soul shatter entering the dark emerald phylactery as it clatters to the floor of the tomb; which the heroes will now have to find a way to destroy before he is able to regenerate. They are then enthralled as they see the shining soul of SAINT BEL’RAA appear before them thanking them for releasing her from the evil curse as she ascends, releasing the seal on her stone tomb. Inside they recover her prized artifact, the amulet of antimagic, but not before being sorely tempted to smoke some of the ancient tomb honey offerings placed in the sarcophagus. In the chamber they also manage to recover a sizable haul of gold coins and ancient artwork, totems, and keepsakes of ALAYA and her disciples. They also recover some of the major artifacts of the apostles of ALAYA: a ring of lesser invisibility, a ring of lesser spell turning, a rope of climbing, a cloak of displacement, an amulet of health, a pole of collapsing, an orb of direction, and a circlet of blasting. Heaving a deep sigh of relief and utterly exhausted through their trials, the party gathers their packs and sets out to return to the surface…


CHAPTER IX “DARKNESS TESTS THE FELLOWSHIP”
1111.2AE
Level 9
As our heroes leave the saint’s tomb, they hear the granite gate stone close slowly as many of the cursed runes turn to dust before their eyes. They make for the seaside cliffs to the west by sundown and there SHOREA bats the dark emerald phylactery of MALDRAK THE BLACKENED out into the dark ocean. As they camp along the cliffs in the cold wind, they spot a flock of hunting harpies offshore. Heading south they enter the DARKWOOD and come across a dark ritual site in a clearing of dead trees. ULRICK attempts to shadily contact OBERON unsuccessfully as ZADSHEN and the others suspect nothing. SHOREA uses his ritual barbarian senses to speak with the gray squirrel GOOD NUT who tells them of the site’s previous use after being fed a goodberry. The next day as they trot through the dead forest, SHO gives into thoughts of bloodshed along the quiet road as his Demon of Rage bound in Glaw breaks through his willpower and manifests on the Material Plane to attack the group. The demon is hard pressed in the melee as it summons two giant abyssal hezrous who leapt into battle to protect their master. The party manages to heroically defeat the demonspawn with SHO dealing the killing blow as a ghostly memory of MASTER WAJA shouts “SHINZOU SASAGEYO!” clasping his scaled shoulder. The party asks concernedly around SHO and the increasing power of his cursed blade. Noticing ULRICK’S new abilities, ARCA and ZAD ask him about his studies in the arcane. ULRICK once again fails to contact OBERON using his sigil of the Fey, and is warned telepathically to contact him alone soon. As the group rides out of the DARKWOOD and enters the plains of the SHADOWLANDS, they spot the tents and campsite of a mercenary company ahead. Speaking and questioning with their leader, whose men laugh at their ignorance of the lands of NEJUNE, ULRICK backs away & decides to stealthily cast modify memory on the mercenary captain. As he utters the spell his lips explode with plagueborn wild magic, covering his skin in signs of blight and instantly killing his horse in a plume of acid. Simultaneously CAPTAIN GORN falls to one knee, charmed into a fugue state where he believes ULRICK and the party had already come this way one day before and done him and his men a favor. The rest of the armed men knock arrows and draw steel shouting for the heroes to explain themselves. ZADSHEN attempts to de-escalate the situation through intimidation, but not before ULRICK once again unleashes his wild magic bringing down a blinding sunburst of flame upon the soldiers burning and blinding many of them; a magical fey banana then appears on his shoulder. Caught off guard, SHO and ZAD charge into the fray cleaving apart the ranks of the stunned men with dazzling killing sprees. ARCA unleashes radiant bursts of dawn and holy flame silencing many more of the blinded guards dashing away madly. As the outnumbered party crushes THE BONE COMPANY camp utterly, they leave CAPTAIN GORN alive as the charmed man tells ULRICK what he knows. He shares that the professional rumor is that THE CIRCLE OF THE MOON is behind The Blight, and to ask his contact HRALF BRUTSTEIN in the BLOATED TOAD in NEJUNE city about how to contact them. He also reveals the location of the chest containing his company’s official mercenary writs inside the main tent. ULRICK casts his pact abilities again this time growing over 10 ft tall via wild magic as he psychically destroys the remains of the captain’s mind. As the heroes overlook the smoldering and massacred battlefield, ARCA erupts with rage scribing that they need to talk about what the fuck is going on…ZADSHEN then delivers a devastatting gut punch into the giant URLICK’S solar plexus bringing him to his senses. When questioned, a teary-eyed ULRICK tells the truth about the pact he made with OBERON, sharing his confusion, sadness, and lust for power. In this moment of psychic turmoil, he sees the face of THALINDRA in the reflection of his magic pendant wishing him to not give into the darkness as she draws her last breath on a cot in the FELLWOOD WATCH. In the next moment OBERON’S voice enters his mind congratulating him on using his new powers, but warns him to contact him successfully before the next dawn or else face the consequences. ARCA and ZADSHEN question the lawless and violent actions of both ULRICK and the seeming indifference of SHOREA, driving a wedge into all the heroes’ hearts. As they solemnly pick through the sellsword campsite and pray over the dead, they uncover several spell scrolls of fireball, scorching ray, detect magic, and identify, including a cursed scroll of gate. The group then equips several +1 moon-touched weapons of choice found in the company’s marked chests. They take the one thousand platinum pieces in the horde, 10 potions of healing, as well as 5 Nejunian art pieces. They also uncover a potent belt of hill giant strength. ARCA and ZADSHEN question the darkness in their companions’ hearts and warn that they cannot walk this path should they go fully down it…SHOREA and ULRICK justify their actions citing the slave hunters’ moral destitution and the need to survive in this desolate land. A dark tension colors the party as they gather their gear and head off into the deepening dusk to make camp away from the carnage of the fresh battlefield…


CHAPTER X “ULRICK FALLS”
Last days of 1111.2AE
Level 10
The heroes make camp at nightfall along a lonely hilltop amid the overcast swamp mists and rot of the open SHADOWLANDS. In the night they spot a line of torches moving miles off. ULRICK finally manages to ignite his fey sigil on a small bush and contacts OBERON, who tells him to either eliminate or severely disenfranchise a man of prominence with a long black scar in NEJUNE. Traveling the shoddy roads south the next day the party arrives at the MAUSOLEUMS OF RUIN finding most of the seven surface tombs sealed. Two have sheer granite walls covered in runes, two others have massive black iron gates barred without locks, two others have iron doors with keyholes where the party attempts to use their mystery key unsuccessfully to unlock. The final tomb has its wooden door shattered with a pile of bodies outside of it; the entrance is shrouded in a magical darkness. ULRICK uses his invisible fey sprite LITTLE LEAF to scout ahead as they hear a low guttural roar of a grave giant crouched inside. They slay the abomination with extreme prejudice after it reanimates multiple times from losing most of its limbs. Entering the darkness they discover they are transported to the dark mirror dimension of the Material Plane, The Shadowfell. Inside all color is washed with creeping gray and black darkness as they find the tomb mostly raided of any valuables, and the skeletons of a few grave robbers littering the alcoves. At the main tomb they find a magical seal containing the soul of KARNAC SHADOWSPELL who appears & offers them great power in a deal to free him. He explains his prison requires an exchange to set his spirit free, which the heroes decide not to risk. Upon hearing that the GOR bloodline now rules NEJUNE he scoffs, explaining when he lived over 400 years ago his bloodline were the masters. His cackling ethereal laughter chills the party to their bones as they leave the dark dimension and return to the surface to continue their 4 day journey to the city of NEJUNE. Upon the road near dusk, they spot using their fey scout a heavily armed AETHERIUS caravan. ZADSHEN hails them and attempts to plant the rumor that HOUSE NEJUNE has been dealing with THE RED HORDE which the merchant captain laughs at. SHOREA asks and blames AETHERIUS for abandoning the GRAY GATE which the soldiers become sour to, denying the claims. After insulting the dragonborn, the merchant noble and his men remount their wagons and continue down the road. Waiting for them to gain distance, mad with power, & enraged by the insult, ULRICK calls upon his wild fey magic and brings down holy flames in a dawnburst around them, instantly killing their horses and searing the men with blinding fire. At the same moment the spell leaves his lips, he rapidly ages over 18 years…
As ULRICK produces his secondhand wand of fireball it malfunctions and explodes showering him and SHO in flames. The cleric manages to land a charged guiding bolt on the closest soldier, which SHO finishes with his longbow. ARCA, SHO, and ZADSHEN begin their wide approach to the caravan sprinting, with ULRICK flanking from the other side. The AETHERIUS veterans then call to form up in a solid spear wall testudo formation using their tower shields and the cover of the wagons to await the belligerent heroes. The noble manages to land multiple well-placed blasts with his wand of fireball on the approaching party, dealing serious damage. The heroes call out and cast wand of web and entangle on the small defensive position, trapping many of the men as a moonbeam rains down on their leader. As they close into melee, both ZADSHEN and ULRICK fall unconscious from the vicious great spear assault. ARCA and SHOREA manage to slay some of the soldiers as ZAD is returned to the battle with healing word jumping into the fray anew. Their hearts drop however when they witness the surrounded & isolated ULRICK slain before their eyes by one of the enraged AETHERIUS soldiers as he yells and drives his spear through his skull. Bleeding and depleted of their magic, the party manages to win the battle by slaying the last guardsmen trading blow for blow amid the magical spider webs and grasping underbrush. Gathering around the corpse of their slain ally, they fall into despair with ARCA once again cursing and questioning his insane behavior. Overcome with grief, ARCA calls upon the divine intervention of ALAYA who manages to grasp ULRICK’S soul and resurrect him as his wounds magically knit leaving a grievous scar. The human paladin is humbled to say the least by the ordeal, having seen his life review and witnessed OBERON’S consternation and also the grace of ALAYA. His body is physically weakened and his lifeforce energy sapped by the ordeal with death. The party rejoices in their dark hour for “ULRICK LIVES!”, as they then find the fine weapons & armor, gold purse, and two hundred pound horde of mastercrafted artworks and artifacts carried by the caravan. LORD FELOR is discovered to be the lesser noble in charge of the men, where they find his house titles, estate map, keys, signet ring, and writ contract to trade with YON’TAL THE DESPOILER in NEJUNE. The haul is presumed to be the finer works from the dwarves and human craftsmen to be enchanted and resold by the mages; the contract was priced at 20,000GP.
The party counts their lucky stars as they regroup and discuss how they can infiltrate this dark land and continue their journey south with only 4 weeks remaining until the Blood Moon…

They discover some disgusting tomb organ dust as well as ghoul jerky. They decide not to eat it.



CHAPTER XII “THE CATACOMBS”

They pay off the sellswords with 500GP to walk away, they agree to continue on as they ascend a ladder into a heavily guarded noble villa. They loot several shipping containers.
Paindrinker hungers, and ULRICK offers his own blood as tribute
Entering a massive natural cavern they spot a massive black python slither away near several rotting corpses 
They enter a large L-junction of 3 prison chambers where a large demon general is bound with arcane shackles. He attempts to make a deal for his freedom resenting being held as a summoned magical battery. The party refuses.
The second prison cell contains dozens of green rune encrusted skeletons chained 
ULRICK sets off a gaseous trap falling into a psychic nightmare sleep taking damage as the specter of THALINDRA haunts him, the heroes retreat back into the caves to avoid the spreading gas
They are ambushed during a short rest by a mob of Umber Hulks and manage to splatter the giant subterranean bugs with killing sprees 


CHAPTER XIII “ZADSHEN’S SACRIFICE”
1111.3AE
Level 10
The heroes re-enter the L-junction and notice and avoid 3 tripwires in a long hallways filled with large veiled urns
Entering level 3 of the 4 in the CATACOMBS they find a well lit dungeon with torches, smooth stone floors, and natural cavern walls. SHO adeptly notices a small flash of steel from cloaked figures on the cliffs above
They are accosted by 4 members of THE NEJUNE THIEVES GUILD who demand they walk back the way they came, the party attempts to parlay with them, but not before one of the rogues revealed the party has bounties on them and attacks.
The party slays the thief captain and 2 of their group, keeping the last alive, JARVEN who they tie up and interrogate. They learn that MAGUS GOR has hired much of their guild promising riches in return for their loyalty in the battle for NEJUNE. The THIEVES GUILD also claims sponsorship over the tomb raider party that released the first seal in the undercroft 3 months ago. He mentions multiple other parties of rogues are patrolling these levels. He says his life is forfeit if he is discovered captive.
The party discovers their images and descriptions now have 1,000GP bounties on them each, finding the writs in the hands of the thieves 
Scouting with LITTLE LEAF they explore the large complex, finding the remains of a camp nearby with weapon racks and a locked chest. Inside the rack they find a long moonspear with elvish language engraved on it, an heirloom of OBERON and SILVANUS for THE FELLWOOD. Using Paindrinker, ULRICK with the help of the Antimagic Amulet is able to spend a half hour breaking the adamantine lock of the chest. Inside they find a breathing bubble, a satchel of rubies, and a magical dwarven tankard. There is a note in thieves cant from AMAN DRAKENSLAYER inside as well, who stashed the chest.
The party gathers rubble to guard the small camp and takes a long rest as LITTLE LEAF keeps watch; the night passes without incident. 
The next day as the party explores the upper cliffs and rooms using their rope of climbing, LITTLE LEAF spots a stealthed party of half-orc warriors, masked assassins, and hooded masked necromancers approaching from the east.
Battle ensues as the half-orcs rush the party and scale the cliffs attacking with their great weapons. The rogues turn invisible and land multiple devastating sneak attacks on ULRICK who resists their poison. The mages blast SHO with necrotic darts and then enlarge one of the half-orcs into monstrous size.
Fiercely battling the two warriors atop the cliffs, ARCA and SHO leap down to fight the rogues and mages as ZADSHEN and ULRICK finish killing the half-orcs.
ULRICK casts globe of invulnerability and ages again a few years, also turning his hair long, thin, and stark white with wild magic 
One of the mages blasts the heroes atop the cliff with a fireball
SHOREA roars and leaps down upon one of the mages, killing him outright in a top rope Perc Angle maneuver
ARCA summons a celestial avenger who battles valiantly and tells the party to run…
As the battle turns they hear a thunderous explosion of giant stones from behind the mages and a rushing of wind, as one of them shouts “NEERIUS!”, turning in terror…
The ancient vampire LORD NEERIUS, released apparently by THE CIRCLE from the second sealed gate in the undercroft appears
NEERIUS immediately teleports behind one of the mages in a flurry of small bats, his clawed hand enlarges with razor talons as he grabs the man's head and bursts it like a ripe melon. Turning to the rogue nearby he speaks an ancient curse and instantly power word kills the man outright, ripping his soul from his body
Simultaneously, another cloaked group of rogues approaches from the south, spotted by ZADSHEN and ARCA. ARCA immediately drops a Dawn onto them searing them with the sunlight
The rogues to the north upon seeing the vampire’s rage, flee to the west.
The angelic avenger steps in front of the vampire and sears him with his radiant sword, telling the party to flee again…
NEERIUS transforms into a giant bat and flies into the darkness above, later raining down an overcasted fireball killing two of the rogues, the angel, and severely burning the party
ARCA and SHO call for a tactical retreat as the party heads back west..
At this moment, the demon or rage battles with SHOREA’S will and takes control of his sword hand….refusing to deflect one of the fire grenades thrown by the rogues…
As the remaining rogues flee for their lives, ZADSHEN steels himself and roars with rage charging the vampire, unable to turn from the fight
SHO now has transformed into a black and red fiery demon form, turning Glaw into a sword of flame
NEERIUS steps towards SHO and tries to dominate him with his flashing eyes, after he resists, the vampire bites down onto his neck cursing him with vampirism should he die 
ZADSHEN crashes into the lord, and delivers a devastating combo of hasted power smites and gravely wounds NEERIUS preventing him from self-healing and enraging him
NEERIUS, filled with hatred for the holy paladin, summons a pack of six vargheists who descend upon ZADSHEN and bring him down in a flurry of bites, tearing out his throat as the party looks on in slow-motion filled with terror…
ULRICK then drops a sunburst onto the fiend and his slaves, searing them with daylight and killing the bat demons outright…the wild magic causes his form to shrink almost two feet however…
As the party watches on the vampire attempts to transform into a bat and escape, SHOREA wins the inner battle with the demon and makes a last heroic swing of his blade, devastatingly critting the fiend and destroying his soul
Just moments before, THE SILVER SENTINELS had arrived from the far eastern cave and stand in awe in time to witness the absolute cinema
SHO sees a peaceful mirror dimension in his mind as he re-transforms, hearing Bahamut speak through MASTER WAJA and see all his fallen kin
ARCA rushes to ZADSHEN and revives him back to life, he rises in shock bearing now a massive scar on his neck 
ZHANG LI, the leader of THE SENTINELS steps forward and claps arms with the heroes like a Chad
The other heroes share they are looking for their captured wizard companion, believed to be held in a villa somewhere by YON’TAL. They were sent by SER LORA of DARGO to investigate the machinations of NEJUNE in the coming coup…
It is believed that multiple NEJUNE agents have already infiltrated DARGO’S noble houses 
The parties team up as the SENTINELS lead them back east and up a rope to a previously campsite they used days before.
They make camp and share stories, with CHRISTOF the thief blowing his magical whistle to shield their camp in a wall of silence
ELENA the bard shares a mythic song her mentor taught her that spoke of a time when all the avatars of the gods walk AETERNUM, there will come a day where it will either be destroyed in a cataclysm or will ascend into its own plane…the mist supposedly has something to do with this
They believe UGLUK has achieved demi-godhood and this is the reason for his armies’ victories
The SENTINELS share that the CIRCLE, MAGUS GOR, the NEJUNE THIEVES GUILD, and multiple other power players are now competing for dominance in these lands, backstabbing and making multiple alliances with each other
They also mention encountering black scaled dragonborn shinobi, linking THE GOLDEN ORDER also into these alliances 
SHOREA re-enters meditation and contacts BAHAMUT, who returns him to the same mirror plane he witnessed when he slew NEERIUS. Speaking through WAJA, his god reveals that he has a choice to make soon, he must exorcise the demon in order to learn Glaw’s true name and unleash the real power of his dai katana. It is also revealed that his fate and ZADSHEN’S are intertwined, as the Demon of Rage shares a twin soul with the Angel of Will. Currently the demon of rage is dominating this form, though the unseen aid this whole time for SHO was coming from the angel. He also sees the greatest of the three, the Demon of Hatred bound in the TOWER OF DUSK combined with the Angel of Knowledge. In this twin soul the Angel is dominant though corrupted. He also glimpses the third Demon of Fear combined with the soul of the Angel of Virtue, located in a MERIA galleon somewhere in the north sea. This being is in equal balance between the two souls. He is told to look for Bahamut’s omen of silver wings…
ZADSHEN contacts LEVIATHAN in a dream state, being shown the link between the angel souls and the demon souls through metaphor. He also glimpses an ancient vision of Celestials grasping forearms in alliance with HOUSE AETHERIUS. He is shown a vision of a celestial kingdom spanning the continent, shielding the peoples of AETERNUM and ushering in peace. He is shown too what should happen if he fails, as MERIA falls in flames and all the RED HORDE’S armies then descend en masse onto the battle lines of AETHERIUS. He hears of The Qunari, the ancient order his bloodline has ties to that will ultimately decide his fate…though it is currently unclear how….
ULRICK prays to SILVANUNS, much to OBERON’S dismay as he sees a vision of a forest clearing where the wooded avatar cannot speak to him audibly…SILVANUS instead shows him images of what could happen on a timeline where THE FELLWOOD WATCH allies with THE FEYWILD to defend the forests. He also reveals a timeline where if he should fail, the forests will burn as THE RED HORDE overruns the hard-pressed defenders of the wood. ULRICK can become that bridge.
ARCA prays with divination to ALAYA and asks about allying with THE SENTINELS, she blesses the alliance. He also asks about what would happen if they continue their pursuit in NEJUNE, and the omen is ill, showing MERIA potentially falling in the war. He then asks about his fate, the goddess reveals that his fate is his own, but there may come a time where he lays down his life for her. He chooses not to reveal this last knowledge to his companions. 
The next morning they council with the full party , deciding to return to the surface and head to the black market fence and loyal thieves guild contacts known by CHRISTOF to find where their friend is held.
SHO uses ELENA to purchase a hat of disguise, as the dragonborn sticks out for his bounty, due to the city now being under a crackdown for NEJUNE enemies of the state. Guard patrols have been doubled. The bounties would have been distributed among all the factions present…
They return to the surface and head to the slums and undercity where they sell and buy several magic items using the wily old fence intro’d by CALADENN
The combined party now heads for the west coastal cliffs  just outside of NEJUNE where one of YON’TAL’S estates overlooks the sea, under new intel gathered their lost companion is being held inside. They prepare to run the extraction operation… 


CHAPTER XIV “THE SENTINELS ARE BROKEN”
1111.3AE
Level 11
The heroes make their way through the city in disguise and are stopped by guards at the western gate, CHRISTOF greases their palms with 200GP to allow them to pass when questioned
They head to the coastal cliffs where 3 noble villas stand, YON’TAL’s being the easternmost, giving the thief all of their “greaseman gear”, he cloaks and scouts out the manor relaying with his sending stone that he counts at least 16 guards and has detected multiple magical traps of alarm
They wait until nightfall and approach the front gate, using cloaked fairies to deliver devastating fire grenade attacks on the catwalks filled with guards 
The two parties storm the upper window and the front door, setting off trapped necrotic sigils and encountering multiple half-orc and human warriors swarming within the compound awaiting their approach
ULRICK, CHRISTOF, and ZADSHEN enter through the upper window and pull off dazzling combat stunts earning them killing sprees on the guards below…
ZHANG LI supported by ELENA sprints inside first and crushes skulls with his blinding martial arts, also taking the brunt of the damage, backed up by ARCA and SHOREA entering and fighting deeper into the manor
They manage to slay most of the initial fighters and soldiers around the entrance when a cloaked mage appears and manages to use his wand of dominate person on ARCA, SHO then quickly steps in and dismembers him
ULRICK uses his fairies as the battle dies down to scout ahead into a storage room, throne room, and dining hall, deciding to push deeper into the other small compound
SHO using the Amulet of Antimagic manages to disable a huge dragon sigil as well as locked doors, as they chase another cloaked mage fleeing down the corridor. His fireballs and magic missile assaults splash harmlessly against the invulnerable magic orb on SHO.
CHRISTOF, ZHANG, and SHO are the first to dash down the hallway to find the cell the fleeing mage was baiting them to in which YON’TAL is waiting with a chained and badly beaten AMAUD
To their horror, YON’TAL cuts the throat of the helpless wizard with his cursed Dagger of Heronimus, causing the SENTINELS to undergo crushing rage and despair
Time slows as ZHANG LI makes a Heavenly Pact with LOKHIR blasting the chamber with the sheer pressure of his wild Ki, halving his lifespan in return for superhuman strength, speed, and stamina as he charges ahead with rage. He manages to shatter the warded bars of the cell using his enhanced greaves and unleashes a devastating combo onto YON’TAL nearly killing him and leaving him paralyzed.
SHO steps in skewering the other mage to the stone using his wakizashi as his amulet blocks all magic from manifesting
The other heroes rush in too late as CHRISTOF and ELENA are paralyzed by despair
YON’TAL manages to will his broken body to flee, taking multiple final attacks before revealing an illusory wall into a spell chamber where he escapes through a gate into a fiery & smoking plane smiling with cruelty as he does
ARCA rushes forward attempting to revive CHRISTOF but to their horror it does not work…they realize YON’TAL wields one of the 3 legendary Daggers of Heronimus banishing the soul of the slain, meaning only a Wish spell could bring him back 
ULRICK at this point had his fairies spot an approaching party with a shackled arcane orge and guards coming from behind them, to which the heroes quickly set a trap using an oil flask
Dropping a crippling dawnburst onto the group most are blinded as they run in and slip and fall into the slick oil puddle
ZADSHEN steps forward with rage and power smites the slave ogre into hell, completely dismembering the beast
CHRISTOF shakes off his feelings, and dashes in to join the fray alongside a raging ZHANG
ELENA shakes off her pain at the loss of her lover, and spitefully pulls out a cursed red bowl which she pour her own blood into [to the cries of dismay from the other SENTINELS], summoning a potent demon to her side. She forces the demon to tell her where YON’TAL escaped to, the elemental plane of fire. The demon is commanded to quickly destroy the other guards before she asks to be taken to the NEJUNE noble to exact her revenge, the demon cackles mentioning the price she will have to pay as he opens a gate to unknown plane of fire and vanishes with her in tow
The other guards ignite the oil with fire grenades, but are quickly dispatched as ULRICK blocks them in with a globe of darkness
ZHANG and CHRISTOF are devastated, realizing now that the SENTINELS are broken. ZHANG removes his white robe and wraps the body of AMAUD in it as he says he will now return to DARGO, solemnly walking out of the carnage.
CHRISTOF stays thanking the party and trying to regain his composure, he takes a sending stone with him, telling the party to re-meet up with them in DARGO, at the TEMPLE of LOKHIR or THE MARKET DISTRICT
The party searches the entire manor, finding a large cargo of prized Shadow Ore, artwork, gems,  hordes of gold, 2 powerful unidentified shields as well as a translucent greatsword of power. Though much of the items and documents seem to have been hastily removed…
They discover a magic summoning circle as well as a portal into the NEJUNE teleportation network requiring a sigil stone and password…
They also recover several spell scrolls and spellbooks in the hidden cell chamber, finding a note from YON’TAL to NEBULOS instructing him to torture AMAUD, a lesser DARGO noble, for any and all information about the house to increase the intel for the coming attack
In YON’TAL’s remaining notes and documents they reveal a missive about “The Toad, The Owl, and The Rat” being in position inside DARGO, as well as economic ledgers and slave quotas from MAGUS GOR demanding that HOUSE NEJUNE strengthen itself before the BLOOD MOON and in the coming months
GOR has also summoned all spellcasters in HOUSE NEJUNE of 7th level or higher to report for mandatory interrogation and conscription at NEJUNE TOWER in 2 weeks
The documents reveal that the plan for the DARGO coup and BLOOD MOON ritual on 1111.4AE seem to be accelerating, though the details are unclear 
In YON’TAL’s private journal in his chambers, he reveals his failed attempts to contact THE OUTER REALM as well as abyssal planes in order to make a pact of power to overthrow MAGUS GOR
Documents also show that GOR was planning to ally with NEERIUS
The party plants one Magic Mystery Bean in the villas which sprouts into 3 confused treants, who break apart the entrance as they exit and make for the FELLWOOD not wanting to join the war. SHO names them Matthew, Mark, and Luke
They run back to the city in the middle of the night, avoiding the refugee camp outside the gates and talk their way past the guards
The heroes discouraged by the failure of their mission and the loss of the SENTINELS, decided to “pull a magic bean 9/11” on the TOWER OF NEJUNE and have the cloaked fairies carry cups of dirt and water 3 beans at the base of the tower
2 of the cups erupt into enraged Bulettes who start attacking the guards while the third sprouts into 16 magical pink toads which all polymorph into random large creatures setting off a scene of panic
ULRICK sends the fairies in again with 3 more beans, this time one turns into a magical blue bonfire, one spouts a giant magical mango tree, and the third spews forth 16 more toads which increase the chaos and puts the entire city into a state of alarm as the guards toll the bells
The final 3 beans manage to create a nest of poisonous magical eggs and another final roulette of 14 toads …. The last and final bean [ULRICK hoping for a massive pyramid manifesting] was destroyed close to the tower caught in the blast of a wind spell before being able to sprout….
A massive pillar of smoke and fire cover the tower as dozens of dinosaurs, wild beasts, demons, angels, aberrations, monsters, and livestock battle with 100s of NEJUNE soldiers and mages in a “zoological terrorist attack” of unprecedented proportions 
Notably a giant owl, a griffon, a young copper dragon, and a mighty planetar all fly away into the night
Huge killing frenzies are carried out by skeletal minotaurs,fire & water elementals, a giant bone naga, zombie ogres, a frost demon, aboleth, allosaurus, and giant rot trolls
KRISTOF FARLINGTON tragically loses his life in the ensuring battle
100s of soldiers and casters litter the dead on the battlefield, as shield walls of troops protect NEJUNE mages launching fireballs, lightning bolts, and magic missiles to slay the rampaging horde of monsters. They eventually retreat into the tower as reinforcements pour into the tower plaza walls…
In the devastating melee, the frost demon stands alone after dueling the last wounded behemoths and is finally slain by the spells of the mages covered high in the tower
The heroes look on in wonder through the fairies’ eyes as the entire city wakes up to the attack, commoners run in terror as the light of the flames lick over the inner city. Guards have placed a quarantine perimeter 250ft into the city in all directions of the TOWER and have sealed the city gates from anyone leaving or entering…
The fellowship plots their next moves, sipping ales inside a middle class inn THE BROWN PONY nearby…


CHAPTER XV “THE VOYAGE TO DARGO”
1111.3AE
Level 12
The heroes keep a low profile staying at THE BROWN PONY while the city of NEJUNE goes into lockdown with the guards and mercenaries checking everyone and questioning many
They make contact with CHRISTOF through the sending stones and he tells them that the FENCE in the undercity may be able to get them out, also that he confirmed the CIRCLE is behind the Blight in some way
ULRICK gains a tip from a drunken dwarf that NEBLUOS is known to frequent THE SCARLET DRAKE, the main brothel in town. He heads inside using his gold and charms to speak with The Madame there and learns that NEBLUOS is headed to the port to escape…
They head to the FENCE and make a deal with gold to be smuggled out of the city and head to the docks
They manage to get there through paying off guards while hidden in cargo containers, managing to see NEBULOS cloaked with some other men boarding a ship headed to MERIA. They decide not to engage and blow their cover 
OBERON reveals to ULRICK that he was being tested, and though his mission is complete as NEBLUOS now will either be hunted or recruited by the other mage lords in NEJUNE now that his master has disappeared and his operations disgraced. OBERON does tell ULRICK that in the coming wars, he does not care who wins, just as long as NEJUNE cedes territory and gets hurt. He tasks ULRICK with making sure this happens.
They speak to the dwarf with red hair CAPTAIN RONGAR SALTBEARD who is headed to MERIA asking about his cargo
The heroes end up hiring CAPTAIN NARTH, a human sailor from NEJUNE to take them south to the slave mines near KULRATH on their own business, he agrees to sail there and wait 1 day for them
The party lands on the docks near KULRATH and sees many cloaked elven taskmasters checking the cargo of the ships there, moving slaves and shipments of crates. The party stealth into the night and locate an iron mine nearby.
Using LITTLE LEAF to scout, they find a fenced area near the mine and go invisible to “seal team assassinate” the four guard towers splitting up to silence them from activating their bells of alarm. One of the guards at the camp notices SHO’S cloaked form moving the tall grass, but the heroes rush in and kill all but one guard who escapes into the mine….
The bewildered human, half-orc, and gnome slaves begin to flee outside
Entering the mine, the heroes quickly dispatch the remaining guards who rush them, making quick work of the lesser fighters. They then split up and entered the mine freeing the rest of the slaves there with the keys…
SHO is surprised to find 5 dragonborn inside, the elder red GAEJEN, the two young reds KI and KAI, and two older merchants with blue scales TALREN and BERAI. They are also joined by a strong half-orc slave BJORK and a shady man JOHN SMITH who decide to run with the party…
SHOREA offers to gather the slaves and make for their vessel docked near KULRATH, saying he will be able to feed them and take them to safety in DARGO…however many of the slaves start to feel in panic preferring to avoid the cruelty of the slave-catchers and take their chances on the road to the safety of FELLWOOD villages. SHO offers them supplies and gold.
ULRICK heads back to CAPTAIN NARTH who tells them to come to an abandoned beach outside town to the south where they can swim abroad without being seen
Setting out to sea, they make their 5 day voyage towards DARGO hugging the coastline with their small merchant vessel sailing at full weight capacity
SHOREA and the dragonborn share stories, some knew his parents, and are eager to learn to sail and learn from the samurai. Many of them were captured as slaves years ago either during merchant travel or through being caught in the wild before DRACONISS fell…
A huge storm is seen brewing to the east, the CAPTAIN decides to drop anchor and wait it out for a day offshore
During the night, the heroes spot a sailless vessel moving in the dark of the night sea, headed straight for them. Upon closer inspection, they see the characteristic stealth blackwood design of a GOLDEN ORDER corsair rushing to ram them.
As the ninja roar with speed trying to ram their smaller vessel, NARTH rallies the heroes and slaves to use all their strength to turn the ship sharply and avoid the collision…the boarding action then begins as the black dragon ninja HIREN GAJUMARA exclaims that SHO is hunted and doomed.
Poisonous shuriken and crossbows fly across the decks, stunning and later paralyzing those hit, as smoke bombs rain down on the heroes and their allies
SHO and ZADSHEN run and jump across entering the fray, trying to draw fire and aggro away from the weaker slave fighters
KI and KAI try to emulate their hero and fail jumping through the black smoke to clear the other deck, being forced to swim back to their ship…
ARCA and ULRICK unleashed devastating spells onto the ninja, burning them with radiant dawn and sunfire ... .ULRICK manages to unleash fearful wild magic that turns many of the ninjas into blinding horror…
HIREN shadow steps onto the other boat however and goes on a killing spree taking the lives of many of the slaves and NARTH’s crew. He unleashes the Shikai incantation of his twin cursed katanas Shiren and Shouzen managing to severely injure ZAD and ULRICK
CAPTAIN NARTH and all but two of his men are slain, along with KI, KAI, and JOHN SMITH…
Seeing the dragonborn he swore to protect die, SHO goes into a rage giving over his control to the Demon of Rage as the demon destroys many of the shinobi and faces off against HIREN. ZADSHEN at this point finally rushes in dealing massive damage  to win with URLICK’S killing blow finally defeating the black scaled assassin. The heroes clean up the remaining ninja and take their ship.
As SHO urges the demon to finish their foes, the fiend turns to raise his blade against GAIJEN to which SHO roars in defiance and takes back control, swearing now to not use Glaw and exorcize the demon at first opportunity
In despair, SHO seeing the dead urges ARCA to revive them, he is able to bring back KI and KAI choosing the slaves over the sailors, using all of his spells and also again calling upon ALAYA’S DIVINE INTERVENTION who answers re-attaching the head of one of the dragonborn
The remaining two sailors pledge their service to the heroes as well as the other freed slaves
They stop at a small gnome fishing village XANA where they restock on supplies, here BJORK decides to leave the party as he goes off on his own way. SHO gives him supplies and gold.
The heroes make contact with CHRISTOF who mentions he's on a job, but makes an intro to DOCKMASTER MARETH who awaits them at the DARGO PORT 
They arrive in DARGO finally with 7 days left until the Full Moon alignment ritual…they stay at THE SILVER SUN coastal inn
They meet with the top smith in the city MASTER ZERNOS, and ask about forging new items or modding them.
The heroes learn about the 3 most powerful volcanoes [where they may be able to destroy artifacts] on AETERNUM: MOUNT YORDAN a dormant sacred peak above DRACONISS, LOKHIR’S SUMMIT a holy mountain that is dormant just southwest of THE TOWER OF DAWN, and finally the great active & evil mountain THE BLACK MAW far to the northeast of THE MOUTH OF WOE
They go to THE TEMPLE of LOKHR and meet HIGH PRIEST CERAPH who welcomes them and asks the heroes to come with him to DARGO KEEP high in the central castle
They hear that LADY MERA and her knights are currently on a monster hunt of 2 young white dragons terrorizing the villages in the southern foothills of the GRAY MOUNTAINS
SHO also hears about small bands of ronin dragonborn samurai as well as hunters roaming the lands north of DARGO
SER LORA the current regent and steward while BEREN is away at the TOWER OF DAWN welcomes them into the council chambers, where the 12 noble houses are gathered
They notice COUNT PERELLION STURNSTAR, AMAUD’s father, DUKE SRELDON the obese coinmaster, EARL CARTH the sickly-looking spymaster, COUNT QUERLOS, a young and taciturn logistics-focused half-elf, and BARON CHADMERIUS a stout & jacked knight most out of the 12 nobles seated.
LORA and CERAPH ask the heroes to dinner, and using a zone of truth build trust with the party, revealing their password for those loyal to the throne “climbing silver” as well as the small “silver wings” emblem worn by LORA’S private praetorian guard knights…
It is revealed major celestial events of 1111AE are the Blood Moon “Jagai” on 1111.4AE, the Total Lunar Eclipse “Monarion” on 1111.8AE, and the most powerful total Solar Eclipse “Keerios” on 1111.11AE where the winds of magic are most powerful on the continent…
The heroes are now torn with wishing to stop the BLOOD MOON ritual and hear about the major leads they must follow…CHRISTOF and his undercity contacts, exploring the serf movement of stirring rebellion, and using a grand divination ritual to ALAYA and LOKHIR to gain more insight…


ACT III: TURNING OF THE TIDE

CHAPTER XVI “UNTANGLING THE WEB”
Last days of 1111.3AE [4 days until the BLOOD MOON “Jagai”]
Level 12
The heroes see off ARCA at dawn who goes for a grand ritual with CERAPH in the TEMPLE OF LOKHIR that lasts 1 day and 1 night
SHO instructs the dragonborn to study his journals and steel their minds for the dangers ahead
The remaining sailors now refit their GOLDEN ORDER vessel with new masts and rudders, as well as a blue and silver paint job renaming it “SILVER SAIL”
ULRICK manages to meet a group of rogues in the great market+tavern THE GILDED DRAGON and wins over their leader BRAUN who makes an intro for them to THE COLLECTOR in the sewers. ZAD and ULRICK pay for a meeting where they trade PAINDRINKER and gold for FIREBORNE, and ZAD purchases THE HELM OF THE IRONBREAKER
The heroes produced documents and evidence from YON’TAL’s villa of the coming attack and “The Owl, The Toad, and The Rat”
CERAPH urges the heroes to investigate, though SER LORA believes that they should just prepare and defend the city and the nobles
The heroes make for EARL CARTH’s manor where his tall butler LORD LATHIAN interviews them. They wait for the EARL and question him about his investigation, he says he has it under control. He believes the NEJUNE spies must be involved with the serf leaders fomenting insurrection, ZAD’s detect thoughts spell notices he thinks of CHADMERIUS. They leave with him giving up nothing. They do reveal “climbing silver” to this butler though who does not respond…
They notice a cloaked tail in the crowd. LITTLE LEAF also follows CARTH in his carriage as he makes 3 deardrops with masked men.
ZAD goes to these houses but only finds working class people living there…
ZADSHEN also reveals his DRAGONSPEAR [adopted] lineage to multiple at the council and elsewhere….CHRISTOF warns him to keep a lower profile 
They realize that most of the people of DARGO, and even some of the nobility believe the BLOOD MOON attack is simply a conspiracy theory ...since no open war has existed between NEJUNE and DARGO in 200 years…
They finally meet up with a drunken and worn CHRISTOF who they hire to make an intro to THE WARDENS in the undercity, something of a thieves guild black market
They are guided by animal masked men to a jovial masked halfling crime lord who goes unnamed and offers them little…He does mention that if they stole the famed heirloom of DARGO, some kind of ancient cloak he would be willing to kidnap CARTH’S butler and run them mission, or else they would have to pay 30k+ as this was high risk
ULRICK pays him for little info and they leave, seeing them as self-serving and unable to jostle the status quo they have with the DARGO upper world
ZAD meets ELDER KOR and several older commoners around a bonfire who are found to be plotting their strike for the working class. He gives them gold and urges them to not give the nobles a chance to move against them….
OBERON tasks ULRICK with a new mission to obtain a tooth of the great white dragon BEORNN THE WHITE DEATH who is rumored to live atop the frozen peaks of the southern GRAY MOUNTAINS 
SHO discovers a small mercenary band of blue dragonborn THE BLUE FANGS and pays them to meet and help his escaped slaves. He also learns about THE RED TALONS, a party of wayward hunters as well as THE LONE DRAKES, several ronin samurai….they camp north of the city. SHO wants them to all return to DRACONISS one day…
The heroes learn that HIREN GAJUMARA last had a 15k bounty on his head….
ARCA returns a day later from the great ritual - sharing that LOKHIR and ALAYA would not work together, and even HERONIMUS was blocking some of the ritual as all the birds roosting around the temple died during the ceremony
The message he got was “The Owl watches from the tallest trees, the toad swims through the muck, and the rat gnaws on the roots of the Dragonspears…” He also sees visions of commoners dressed in black mourning, with a great funeral procession and people running in terror in the streets. The omens are ill should they continue as ALAYA shares what she can, she urges them to defend the weak and focusing on stop loss instead of discovery as events now have been set in motion that cannot be undone. 
The party learns more of FAGREN DRAGONSPEAR, BEREN’S foppish and decadent son who is his heir though many fear his inept rule. Many of the nobles hate the DRAGONSPEAR rulership as they hold both the crown and the military. The heir to the throne of the DARGO can appoint his own men to Steward and High Priest.
Unsure of where to go next, they are summoned to an emergency war council by SER LORA
Inside all 12 noble houses and their seconds are present, the doors are magically sealed and warded for scrying as LORA shares the news of the realm
HIGH TEMPLAR BEREN has finally convinced HIGH COMMANDER TARIS to commit half of the DARGO army and fleet and half of the AETHERIUS legion to break the siege on outer MERIA. 90% of the outlying villages and farmlands outside the walls in MERIA have already been destroyed, captured, or burned by the marauding hobgoblin and troll vanguard armies of THE RED HORDE. All troops must now rally TO THE TOWER OF DAWN to set out in one week, with the DARGO FLEET leaving soon under SER LORA’S command to support from the sea. A skeleton crew of knights and guards will stay to defend DARGO
A lone dwarven courier was found in AETHERIUS who reports that the leadership of THANE’S HOLD lives, including all of the military heroes. Many nobles and merchant lords along with around 70% of the keep was lost or is missing…A small 30% or less contingent under HIGH KING THANOR is now fighting back the monstrous horrors of THE UNDERDARK being pursued by RED HORDE raiding teams somewhere miles away southwest of their hold underground in THE GRAY WASTES…
EARL CARTH reveals they have gathered new evidence of treason and will be hanging the 5 major leaders of the so-called serf rebellion on the day of the Blood Moon, including ELDER KOR. He says this will destroy NEJUNE’S spy plans if they do exist. 
The fellowship weighs their options carefully as the night foretold draws near. Must they defend the nobles with LORA, or continue to unravel the spider web of clues inside the city? The Blood Moon awaits…

Level 13

The heroes search the tombs and find piles of bones and a collapsed passage, also a natural tunnel entrance…relics of the companions of Lokhir and their trials together in ancient AE are revealed through CHADMERIUS’S tales
They locate the statue of LOKHIR slaying the dragon seen from the scry, and locate LATHIAN mid-regeneration in his tomb. They slay him fully, also seeing the 4 tombs of powerful heroes of old with LOKHIR, one being broken and the death knight raised
Inside they find the vampire’s black book detailing his master EW, and the role of around 30% of CARTH’s agents with a plan set in place for decades to infiltrate DARGO
They also find a skin-bound spell tome and several rune encrusted diamonds as well as platinum pieces, also in his notes are coded dates and times describing orders to his agents 
When they emerge to find CARTH he reports a shadow has lifted from his mind 
They return with the news to SER LORA who takes all of this as evidence and shares his man searching for FAGREN at one of his “lover” noble daughters’ villas has not returned
An agent from the WARDENS also comes to discuss terms, offering the hostages for honoring of their truce as well as being allowed to set sail. LORA counters that GREY SCAR needs to come here himself or else he will seize the ships and invade the undercity lair
The heroes rest and prepare to head with the team to FAGREN while another strike team of knights heads to the WARDENS
CAPT GAUL and his praetorian guard come with the heroes to the villa with a commoner staff in shock trying to send them away
Once inside GAUL demands an audience with the prince with his royal seal and the terrified staff freeze, one maid points to an upstairs room 
They enter finding FAGREN and a group of readied hired killers waiting for them, he has the noble maiden at knifepoint sharing how everyone has always shamed him and now it’s his time to take the throne. He bids them join him in his coup or die.
ZADSHEN disgraces him and in a moment of heroically “locking in” hurls his blade at the prince while the maiden dodges last minute as the sword impales him and sends him over the second story balcony
GAUL rushes to secure the woman as the assassin descend on the party while ULRICK unleashes a scroll of cloudkill 
SHO enters the melee along with the knights as GAUL is brought near death struck down with multiple combos
ULRICK blasts two of the killers over the ledge with well-timed eldritch blasts 
ZADSHEN sprouts his wings and rushes forward grabbing the noble and hurtling over the ledge. He is later brought down by multiple assassins blades before he can recover…though the woman manages to flee
SHO, ULRICK and the guards manage to slay through the remaining assassins as they attempt to flee over the ledge, only to get “Perc Angle” killing spree’d by SHO 
ULRICK then leaps down and casts sleep on the fleeing prince
They stabilize and heal up with bandages and potions, returning to DARGO KEEP with a hooded FAGREN, they find a coded map on him describing a dead drop 
Once they arrive LORA says not only have THE WARDENS not responded but his men sent to their lair were seen killed by some kind of paralyzing trap. In rage he has ordered the DARGO fleet to board and capture their vessels. Upon hearing this SHO races off to join the sea battle fearing for the Dragonborn.
Inside LORA demands only “climbing silver” members stay for the interrogation where they insult and intimidate the broken Prince into explaining his treason. He agrees to talk given criminal immunity barring his father BEREN’s judgment which LORA acquiesces to. 
He reveals that all three moles are connected although he doesn’t know how, the toad bought his loyalty with a promise of 150k GP and the throne, with he and the owl having been in position years before they approached him. His hired men from NEJUNE planned to poison and assassinate the noble council once gathered where he would then seize the throne. He believes both ELDAN and GOR are involved but doesn’t have proof of the latter…documents proving this are in his manor.
He claims NEJUNE doesn’t actually plan to attack the city itself, but somewhere else. Also that the WARDENS have been building a gate of some kind in the deepest undercity, which is 80% complete under GREY SCAR who is actually a greater doppleganger from THE OUTER REALM.
 The Prince says at least 10 more assassins assigned to him went rogue this morning and are in the city somewhere. Now LORA, CHADMERIUS, and many of their royal guard are searching the city and trying to decipher the agent list and map to find the remaining rogue agents under CARTH and FAGREN before the Blood Moon rises in 4 hours…
LORA asks the party to join the now full on invasion of THE WARDENS lair to bring GREY SCAR to justice and stop whatever they have been building
CERAPH will be holding a massive ceremony to focus all of the wild emotion of the DARGO people at the TEMPLE OF LOKHIR, the winds of magic have filled the city with a palpable tension as the clock ticks on….the heroes split up, exhausted, yet ready to turn history, now they look on to Fate….



CHAPTER XIX “THE END TIMES BEGIN”
1111.4AE [days following the BLOOD MOON “Jagai”]
Level 13

The heroes join COUNT STURNSTAR and the team that will teleport down near the location where they sensed the massive transmutation aura
SHOREA aids the DARGO fleet in capturing the 3 WARDEN ships and rescues the Dragonborn there 
CHADMERIUS and several knights will breach at the same time through the sewer entrances to the last known location of the slain praetorian guard
The party appears down in a deep layer of the undercity where the ancient stone built at DARGO’S founding mixes with raw earth
They avoid several traps, though one of the guards goes mad when he steps over a gateway of glowing green alien runes
They enter a wide chamber filled with magical devices and construction materials  after several tunnels where GREY SCAR and several other wardens awaits, powering 3 massive crystal pylons connected to a glowing purple & blue stone gateway
The battle ensues with one of the warden mages shattering the closest crystal pylon as a purple & red alien hulk leaps into action
PERELLION manages to pull off an enhanced timestop with his staff of the magi, summoning a fire elemental and buffing himself with illusory closes and ethereal armor
The fire elemental sears and burns several of the wardens as the alien hulk rushes in and manages to “Bane” multiple knights over his knee before tearing one in half after being enlarged by a spell
ULRICK unleashed a globe of invulnerability where the heroes took shelter in before scorching several of the wardens with a blinding dawnburst
ZADSHEN’S smites and the others manages to slay the massive alien hulk and finish off survivors, while SHOREA is dominated with a psychic vision of the greater doppleganger assuming the form of his master
The Count tells to bring down the pylons before the gateway powers up, as they smash one with fireballs and lightning bolts, the heroes rush to the other as the remaining dopplegangers pull back and charge the gateway with psionic energy
In this moment the DEMON OF RAGE takes over SHO and unleashes a firery getsugatensho that slays the other STURNSTAR mages and also kills the remaining wardens
The heroes narrowly kill GREY SCAR as the portal overloads and starts to collapse the entire cavern…as the portal closes they witness a giant webbed arm reach through before being severed by the psionic matrix exploding…..they rush away as the whole undercity complex shakes apart as water rushes in 
The heroes aid the count as he stumbles and SHO throws the 2 dead mages over his back carrying them out, though he forced to drop one to maintain speed
They find a battered CHADMERIUS with only one eye and a few remaining knights as they escape the lower chamber to the surface, narrowly avoiding the cave-in and flooding
The party returns to the keep amidst rioting crowds who have spilled out of the temple of Lokhir to report they have now foiled the 3 spies and the plan to destroy DARGO, LORA commends them and also has CERAPH returned to the castle under guard as the commoners rampage and protest throughout the city
They stay in the castle for the evening, sharing a hard-win yet tense dinner with the nobles….only to hear the ill news of the rest of the realm

The DARGO people burned and looted, though no major damage was done as many just wined, wenched, and raged under the influence of the blood moon
The news from NEJUNE is ill as thousands of slaves were sacrificed in a massive blood ritual … MAGUS GOR has now become the avatar of HERONIMUS and has openly declared war on the realms under the ancient “dark power thesis” which states only the magical elite should rule. He has summoned a massive undead horde and awakened the grave titan generals as he now moves to invade the FELLWOOD
The news from MERIA isn’t better as UGLUK has finally appeared on the frontline and single-handedly broke the gates of the city along with a giant and troll horde. As the avatar of BEL’MOG his armies are now razing the city, with the MERIA guilds fighting room to room along the streets with ambush and trap tactics. The situation is grim as they are being overwhelmed through sheer numbers.
AENARION has successfully become the avatar of SILVANUS with the help of FAYRUS and the avatar of ALAYA MISTRAYA…they now seek to protect their borders against the NEJUNE invasion from the south 
THE ARKEN COMPANY led by CICERO himself have assassinated all the noble lords of AETHERIUS save LORD APELION sending the city into political turmoil….it's unclear who hired the hit
Most urgent is the TOWER OF DAWN where TARIS and BEREN along with around 20-30% of their house military forces were stationed has come under planar attack as a massive orb gateway to THE OUTER REALM has decimated the fortress…LORA asks the heroes to depart there and rally to the king as soon as they can
The party and Capt Gaul with his guard rush to the tower of dawn, they are teleported to the lake of dawn first
They cannot penetrate the magical barrier and suffer psionic damage, they find dead, mutated, and insane soldiers along the way
En route they spot a massive flying shadow near the peak of LOKHIR’S SUMMIT, rumored to be the elder blue dragon 
One live soldier tells them to ride north, where they find TARIS and BEREN and a small group fighting off weird monstrosities. They meet with them and decide to return to DARGO asap. GEREN has fallen as the king laments his bastard son, he is also mad and blames TARIS for the war
The heroes give him the gear of LOKHIR which seems to restore him
They speak of horrors beyond imagination, non-Euclidean geometry, time distortion, and worse….also citing the appearance of dopplegangers, a beholder, and mindflayers 
They find a boat and return to DARGO, ULRICK rides ahead on his summoned steed to bring aid 
The 2 commanders share along the road that they just stop MERIA from falling before turning to NEJUNE

Level 15

The heroes sneak into the hills surrounding the beachside GOLDEN ORDER camp and send in 2 cloaked faeries to run back “Bean 9/11”.

A unicorn appears due to the wild magic and refuses to heal ULRICK unless he vows to serve the light, then SHO rides it on the beach before it teleports away
ULRICK learns new secrets of the arcane as well
ZADSHEN grabs the Luck Blade and makes “The King Wish”, wishing to have BEREN abdicate his throne make him king of DARGO as the most powerful heir available…a huge peal of thunderous lightning crashes in the background on the beach in the deep of night as he does. Unknown consequences of changing Fate are presumed to have happened….but ZAD feels nothing. He sends to BEREN later and the king responds with ire calling him “usurper”....
In a trance, a massive faceless black and white angel appears before ZAD and warns him that he has chosen earthly kingship over mortals instead of receiving sanction from THE QUNARI, and is hereby banned from entering the 7 Heavenly Planes….he receives a falling star scar on his chest…
The heroes strike the camp and burn all of the supplies and bodies they did not loot, waiting until nightfall the next day to windwalk. ULRICK tries to swim after a massive dragon turtle at sea who dives away
They learn the next supply shipment will arrive in 1 week

The heroes fly across the deep waters through a storm and manage to land for a moment timing their windwalk with dawn to fly the rest of the way exhausted to the shores of the ISLE OF THE DRAGON
The island appears empty except for small insects and sea birds, so they approach the central mountains after SHO confers with BAHAMUT who tells him of the draconic runic entrance
ZADSHEN prays to LEVIATHAN and learns he is an ally to THE QUNARI, and though he has altered fate with his king wish and apparently broken the unknown pact with the celestials, his mission to the dragon god remains the same
They fly up to the tallest mountain and spot 3 red dragons roosting as well as a larger port settlement far to the north of the island…They sneak into the entrance and SHO opens the gateway into THE TEMPLE OF BAHAMUT
Inside they battle huge flightless gray dragon beasts who breathe burning hot steam, along with a GOLDEN ORDER beastmaster, some kind of mutant breeding project they heard mentioned in the notes found at the beach camp, including pedigrees for the various chromatic dragons they are breeding here 
After slaying these beasts, LITTLELEAF and SHO encounter pressure plate traps, tripwires, as well as draconic force field walls that deal heavy damage to them asking if they serve TIAMAT or not 
They continue down a massive hallway flanked by an abyss, heralded by great statues of the knights of BAHAMUT from ancient times, now defaced and covered in vile runes to The Chaos Mother
They make their way into the throne room where they see the raised dais and shrine to BAHAMUT, now desecrated for TIAMAT, inside they see EDORA THE RED FIST along with a red, blue, and green dragon lounging waiting for them….
EDORA bankais instantly after SHO and him exchange few words and dashes in blinding speed to the samurai and lays him low with a 6-piece combo of his ki-infused fists
ULRICK and ZAD battle desperately trying to heal SHO, yet also suffering massive blows from the GOLDEN ORDER monk … ZAD manages to land several smites wounding him and ULRICK transforms himself into a terrifying ArchFey casting spell after spell 
EDORA finally manages to lay ZAD low and ULRICK is pinned in with the badly damaged monk and the 3 dragons waiting outside in the eversmoking cloud…The dying EDORA yells “DRACARYS!” telling the dragons to fill the chamber with death
ULRICK grabs the Scroll of Wish, and wishes for his companions to return to full power, they rise from the ground renewed with strength and strike down EDORA, who willingly dies on SHO’S blade whispering “Hail Tiamat”...ULRICK feels his ability to ever cast wish again may be gone as he bends Fate
The heroes narrowly slay the other 3 dragons, with SHO fearing one as it tries to escape through the ceiling
ULRICK uses his euphoria breath of the fey to drive one dragon mad, and then casts modify memory on it, charming and incapacitating it and making it believe SHO to be a friend
The charmed dragon tells SHO that JATO is currently away on a mission in MERIA before the party jumps him dead
SHO steps to the altar of BAHAMUT and falls into trance where he sees the great dragon god battling with TIAMAT, his nemesis. SHO and REN combine their power to slay the dragon goddess and banish the wind of chaos from the temple, freeing BAHAMUT’s power. He becomes his champion and also attains bankai. The entire temple shakes with power as the banners and runes to TIAMAT fall away.
ULRICK notices a hidden stone under the shrine and reveals the legendary artifacts of BAHAMUT, his sword, armor, and orb

The city is divided into the rich farmlands, vineyards, and mines that surround the walls, and then CASTLE DARGO itself. Surrounding the castle are the tournament grounds, the merchant district, and DARGO PORT, a bustling military quarter that governs their fleets. There are rumors that the city also contains a huge network of caverns and sewers used exclusively by the nobles of HOUSE DARGO.


MERIA
Population: 1,300,000
Races: Human/Elven/Dwarven/Halfling/Gnome mixed
The cosmopolitan and free port city that boasts the largest population in AETERNUM. Seat of HOUSE MERIA, this urban sprawl flows with well-earned coin and cultural mirth. Many sects, orders, communities, and conclaves of all races have made their home here due to the meritocratic stance of the nobles of the city. This has also led to a 100-year rule of an advanced criminal syndicate underworld. The city is composed of massive urban sectors known as the TRADE, DOCK, and GUILDHALL QUARTERS. Though their fleets are less focused on war as they are on trade, the fleets of HOUSE MERIA are second only to those of HOUSE DARGO in sea power.

NEJUNE
Population: 210,000
Races: Human
A bleak and mysterious city of incipient shadow and violent excess. Though seemingly less advanced in construction than the other major cities, the seat of HOUSE NEJUNE is the most magically charged settlement in all of AETERNUM. Bordered by the eerie boughs of the DARKWOOD and the swamp-infested wastes of THE SHADOWLANDS. Ruled by necromancers, sorcerers, and seasoned wizards, this is a perilous place for outsiders to tread without great need. The shadowland surrounding NEJUNE is filled with magical traps, labyrinths, catacombs, and all manner of nomadic camps where the outcasts and nefarious races of the land find solace. The lawless city contains the central political and magical spire of NEJUNE TOWER, as well as the NEJUNE CATACOMBS which often function as council chambers and dungeons. The infamous tavern THE BLOATED TOAD is host to all manner of mercenary and brigand villainy inside the lawless city.







THANE’S HOLD
UPPER HOLD HAS FALLEN TO THE RED HORDE
Population: 100,000
Races: Dwarven
The last standing dwarven cityhold on the continent, THANE’S HOLD is a fortress containing a small but stubborn clan of underground nobility. The craftsmen and tinkerers of this hold are held in the highest regard for their work with both weaponcraft and armorcraft, jewels and artifacts. The hold has a massive fortified gate protecting the upper mountain levels where traders are allowed entry ruled over by the THANE’S MERCHANT GUILD headquarters. Under the mountain in the deeper levels lies THE THRONE ROOM, as well as the deeper barracks, mines, forges, and armories kept secret by the dwarves. Known for their ability to mine and shape precious AETERNUM ORE. Though traditionally a neutral city during times of house warfare, there have been rumors that due to the frequent orc and goblin incursions into their lands they have signed secret defensive pacts with unknown parties.

Rumors of the upper holds falling to the RED HORDE onslaughts abound. Hopes that the High King and his people have made a fighting retreat into the UNDERDARK is the word on the street…


TOWER OF DUSK
Population: 30,000
Races: Human and Elven
The massive northern guard tower and fortress of HOUSE AETHERIUS known for its formidable magical arsenal of mages and artifacts. The most powerful magic users of their house are trained and stationed here. Rumor has it that a potent scrying stone, the likes of which does not exist in this age according to scholars, is in use here. This would account for the seemingly omniscient and precognitive ability of HOUSE AETHERIUS lords to know secret information and dealings across the continent. In visions by the party, SHO and ZAD saw The Angel of Knowledge imprisoned here… Now the frontline bulwark of the north against the RED HORDE after the fall of the GATE and THANE’S HOLD.


TOWER OF “DARKNESS” DAWN
Population: 50,000
Races: Human
The white southern guard tower and citadel of HOUSE AETHERIUS where the high generals and legion warmasters are stationed. Here the new recruits and soldiers of the house are armed, tested, indoctrinated, and assigned to their divisions and battalions. There is rumor that the new alliance between the HOUSE DARGO and HOUSE AETHERIUS nobles is largely in contention because of their armies being housed here together. The top generals of each force are diametrically opposed in religion and dogma on how the balance of power in AETERNUM should be decided.
Was largely destroyed and corrupted during the OUTER REALM portal opening there during the blood moon. Land is now filled with eldritch magic and psionic distortions that have created mutants known as THE FORSAKEN and ruined



FELLWOOD WATCH
Population: 60,000
Races: Human/Elven/Halfling
The bastion, trade, and military post guarding over the eastern entrance to The Fellwood manned largely by independent elves, halflings, and men. Here the trappers, traders, hunters, and heroes that run the WATCH largely enjoy immunity to the politics of the four great houses due to their inexhaustible supply of wild game and mercenary companies. Some in the houses speak of a new order forming however, where the mercenary captains, druids, and rangers of the WATCH will soon have to swear fealty in the coming war. The fort city contains a great ash tree at its center surrounded by waystones where the COUNCIL OF THE WOOD was held. The city also includes a large temple to ALAYA, the aerie of the great eagles, as well as the famous Green Oak tavern and inn. 


ALAYA’S REST
Population: 33,000
Races: Elven
A sacred site and well protected outpost west of The Fellwood filled with independents dedicated to the elven goddess of healing and dreams Alaya. Here a small neutral town has thrived through the centuries largely due to machinations of the elven merchants and clerics that have remained fiercely independent due to guile and trade. Something of a pilgrimage lodge exists here welcoming weary travelers from all races, though it is rumored that the price for healing is far steeper than mere gold pieces…


THE GRAY GATE
DESTROYED BY THE RED HORDE DURING THE SIEGE AT THE GATE
Population: 90,000
Races: Human/Elven/Dwarven/Halfling/Gnome mixed
A military outpost and trading settlement largely manned by the bitter rivalry of forces between HOUSE MERIA and HOUSE AETHERIUS. Peace is maintained largely by this being one of the most dangerous settlements with the lowest life expectancy in the land due to the proximity of THE GRAY WASTES. Here the most hardy merchants and brash heroes gather to make camp before continuing onward to deal goods with THANE’S HOLD. There are whispers though that this town shall be the first to fall to the oncoming orc and goblin onslaught, and so has become something of a “wild west” as non-combatants have begun a mass exodus out of fear.




MAGUS RISE
Population: unknown
Races: Monstrous unknown
An ancient power site and temple of unknown significance to the old gods. No faction has ever successfully penetrated its depths and returned to tell the tale. Rumors abound that the innermost underground temple floors are ruled by a gregarious Djinn who will grant wishes to those who can tame the RISE. Others say that a mating pair of evil Red Dragons actually lay claim to the lost treasure hoard buried deep within, left behind by the very founders of AETERNUM from ancient times.  


THE GRAY WASTES
Population: 330,000 estimated
Races: Orc/Goblin/Troll/Kobold/Bugbear/Hobgoblin/Giant/Monstrous unknown
The forbidden mountain plains and wastelands traditionally held by the “evil” races that roam the continent. All manner of orc, goblin, kobold, ogre, troll, & giant tribes constantly war and pillage one another across these desolate expanses. 40 years ago a new orc warlord managed to wipe out or unite the majority of these tribes and has laid waste to any army that has penetrated the GRAY WASTES borders since. Now it seems war is coming to the 4 great houses and beyond…


MOUTH OF WOE 
Population: 100,000 estimated
Races: Orc/Goblin/Troll/Kobold/Bugbear/Hobgoblin/Giant/Monstrous unknown
A legendary entrance into the vast, dark expanse of caverns that lie beneath the Gray Mountains. It earned its name during the War of Beards when the combined dwarven and elven armies fell brutally to the onslaught from the forces of the Underdark. In the present day this huge cave is patrolled at all times by orc warbands and packs of goblin cutthroats. Myths speak of a pathway deep under the mountains that actually tunnels under the sea across into distant lands, though most human scholars dismiss this as merely the chatter of mushroom-addled goblin shamans.



DRACONISS
Population: unknown
Races: Dragonborn
An ancient mountain village, home to the proud race of martial Dragonborn on AETERNUM. Lies in the shadow of the sacred dormant volcano peak MOUNT YORDAN. An old temple as well as the village itself largely lies in ruins due to unknown circumstances. Many in the four houses blame the dormant volcano near DRACONISS. It is known that the dedication of this temple site and dojo was to their samurai lineage and “the first dragon”. Rumors of surviving Dragonborn sighted around the village and wandering the wider lands still fill the lips of many hardened hunters and traders.



FORT BANE
Population: 55,000
Races: Human
One of the best kept military outposts that exists outside the direct control of the four houses, FORT BANE is a citadel run by ruthless mercenary guild masters. It is said they are allowed to wage war and conduct commerce under the blessing of HOUSE MERIA nobles, though no formal treaty exists. The most highly prized assassins and military drill sergeants are available here for hire to the four great houses. In the last 40 years, some of the top commanders and killers serving under the house lords have all come to fame or infamy out of FORT BANE.

MAJOR FACTIONS
POWER RATINGS
Power ratings denote on a scale of 1-10 the combined military, economic, and diplomatic might at the disposal of a given faction. 

HOUSE AETHERIUS
Power Rating: 8/10
Alignment: Lawful Neutral
Leader: High Inquisitor Valus [human cleric]
The house is known for its long reign of military and magical dominance on AETERNUM over the last 200 years of recorded history. Generally seen as the political “leader” among the great houses, the nobles of the AETHERIUS bloodline are unflinching in their dominance and assertion of the status quo as they see fit. It is of note that they openly serve no formal god among the pantheon on AETERNUM. Commanding vast legions of highly trained fighters, paladins, wizards, and clerics, this house has largely been able to control commerce and politics either through prowess on the field of battle or through the table of diplomacy. The current high inquisitor VALUS has not been seen in public for over 100 years however, and there are rumors among the peasantry that he has either long since died or somehow bargained for magically extended life behind the walls of his citadel. The dealings of the house are largely handled in public by his ward High Commander TARIS, a brutal and shrewd military commander known for executing all he conquers in battle. Politically HOUSE AETHERIUS has recently solidified their dominance further by making a pact of power with its traditional enemy HOUSE DARGO to the shock of the other houses. They now publicly pledge to bring an era of peace after crushing the rise of the new orc hordes threatening the northern borders. Meanwhile the peoples of THE GRAY GATE and THANE’S HOLD have borne the brunt of the assault and lost many skirmishes over the past decade. Tensions are building steadily though no formal military or magical action has yet to be seen to face the coming orc and goblin crusade. Rumors abound that a cabal of nobles within the house is secretly in control, and largely focused instead on their magical purges of undesirables led by THE INQUISITION.






HOUSE DARGO
Power Rating: 6/10
Alignment: Neutral Good
Leader: High Templar Beren [human paladin]
A house traditionally dominant due to its maritime and fast-attack military fleets able to control most coastlines on the continent. During the previous wars of the last century HOUSE DARGO was able to win huge victories at sea making them rich with the spoils of these battles. In recent decades they have seen a steady decline in their powerbase due to political machinations by HOUSE NEJUNE sanctioning their prized sea trade of wine and steel. Known for their religious orders of crusader knights and paladins, this house’s armies are formidable both on horseback on the open plain as well as in boarding action on the high seas. Religion and dogma permeate every aspect of the caste system found within their society. They chiefly venerate the god of war and luck Lokhir. Some knights do openly devote themselves to Bahamut as well although it is frowned upon by the nobility as a foreign god. Many a squire, ward, yeoman, and soldier aspire to prove themselves worthy through a mighty quest abroad or victory in a tournament to be admitted to training among the orders of DARGO paladins. Currently High Templar BEREN rules with an iron hand and personally signed the treaty with High Commander TARIS. He believes their new alliance will allow them to finally crush the hated magic power block of HOUSE NEJUNE once and for all, caring little for the brewing border war to the north. What he does not seem to know yet is that much of the populace and lesser nobles are openly plotting against him politically by seeking merely maximum profit through trade with HOUSE AETHERIUS. It should be noted the succession of the throne of DARGO is a hot topic upon the lips of the nobles…




HOUSE MERIA
Power Rating: 6/10
Alignment: Chaotic Neutral
Leader: Guildmaster Oreon [half-elf rogue]
A house known for its mastery in all dealings of commerce, trade, subterfuge, politics, and “underhanded” statecraft. HOUSE MERIA has remained independent from binding treaties and largely unscathed by house wars in the last 100 years because of this. Legendary guilds of charismatic statesmen, thieves, assassins, merchant lords, and pirates dominant its political landscape. Often the leaders of the house are merely tolerated by the others simply due to the leverage and profiteering they exert through their sizable fleet on the seas of AETERNUM. Their leader Guildmaster OREON is the youngest commander among the four houses, and yet demands a fearsome reputation as one of the most lethal & silver-tongued rogues in the land. He is rumored to have deep ties to the vast criminal cartels that run rampant throughout the ports of MERIA. This house worships the god of commerce fervently, the deity known as Ket. Due to their standing armies of grizzled rogues, monks, rangers, and bards, the house is able to marshal fearsome land and sea forces to protect their trade empire. There are rumors that an ancient artifact of terrible power known as The Eye of Ket has been found at sea and will soon change the balance of power among the eternal game of shadow intrigue within HOUSE MERIA. Any criminal guild or pirate fleet that is able to get reliable information on its whereabouts are offering a handsome bounty to any hero who can provide this.






HOUSE NEJUNE
Power Rating: 5/10
Alignment: Neutral Evil
Leader: Magus Gor [human warlock]
HOUSE NEJUNE is rightly feared and simultaneously shrouded in secrecy for commanding some of the most deadly magical forces rivaling even those of HOUSE AETHERIUS. This is a house ruled by vile necromancers raising the dead, insane wizards locked within their towers, and cunning sorcerers dealing magical artifacts openly to the other houses in exchange for favors. In these lands, the god of death & magic Heronimus is the primary idol. They do not have a standing army as such, but merely mercenaries hired by warring circles of potent magical users who will do anything in their power to keep dominance over their slave class. Because of this they have managed to survive the ravages of past wars against HOUSE DARGO and even HOUSE AETHERIUS. When backed into a corner, the other houses have historically stayed their killing blow for fear of the eldritch horror and planar gateways used as a last resort by the Magus lords of HOUSE NEJUNE. Some even say that the ancient temple of MAGUS RISE was created in the dawn era of AETERNUM by just such a cataclysmic spell gone wrong. Others whisper that this ancient site of power is the secret source of the arcane in their lands. Bold adventurers and mercenaries to this day still mount expeditions within their lands to attempt to grave rob and loot the potent magical tombs and grottos surrounding the city. Currently the most powerful warlock and leader of the house, MAGUS GOR, is solely focused on isolationism. He has refused to enter into any formal treaty with the other houses. This has remained the state of play for the last 40 years since his rise to power. There are still rumors circulating however that the NEJUNE nobles are plotting a vicious coup within their ancestral enemy’s ranks of HOUSE DARGO. This rumor sits atop the claim of some peasants that actually a vampire bloodline is really in political control in the city of NEJUNE.






CLAN THORGREM
CLAN LOST THEIR UPPER HOLDS TO THE RED HORDE
Power Rating: 2/10
Alignment: Lawful Good
Leader: High King Thanor [dwarven battlemaster]
This clan of ancient dwarves sits within their ancestral home of THANE’S HOLD mightily despite all the suffering of their people over the centuries in AETERNUM. Legend has it that as far back as 300AE the dwarven house of THANE was the true power in these lands. In the present day however, High King THANOR leads but a fraction of the economic and martial power of his ancestors. Forced to trade with the four great houses and peddle their superior magical weapons, armaments, jewels, and artifacts, CLAN THORGREM has managed to remain neutral for centuries. Their secreted riches and mines are the stuff of legend for the children growing up in major cities of the other kingdoms. The dwarves chuckle at this as they are a very traditional and old people, bound by deep tradition and honor to their ancestors. They worship the god of smithing and courage, Grungnar. In recent decades they have fallen on hard times as the rise of the orc and goblin hordes has gotten out of control, and by some accounts, the worst it has ever been in dwarven veterans’ memory. Due to the renewed onslaught of evil races upon their hold and its trading routes, they have reignited the forges of war and deployed the well-equipped entirety of their legions of fighters, barbarians, clerics, and monks to fend off their ancestral foes. Despite having some of the most powerful shock troops in all of AETERNUM, their elite warriors have simply been ambushed and overwhelmed at every turn. Now there are rumors that THANE’S HOLD will soon shut its gates for good to the trading convoys of THE GRAY GATE and retreat deep within their mountain holds to wait out the coming war. This would spell economic doom particularly for HOUSE AETHERIUS as much of their military dominance is based on this trading agreement.
THE RED HORDE
Power Rating: 7/10
Alignment: Chaotic Evil
Leader: Ugluk the Red [orc barbarian]
A largely ragtag and yet highly ferocious nomadic horde comprised of all of the evil bands and tribes of races ravaging through THE GRAY WASTES. Historically most dangerous to themselves through constant tribal warfare and raiding, since 1,000AE they have seemingly come to heel under a new orc warlord UGLUK THE RED. Little is known of his origins or even his appearance as none among the “good” races have lived to face him in battle. What started with precision raids on outposts and caravans soon escalated to full scale warfare over the last decades. Multiple major assaults were repelled on both THANE’S HOLD and THE GRAY GATE due to the heroic efforts of the defenders. This is not expected to last though as hunter-killer packs of goblins and hobgoblins have stepped up their night raids and assassinations of military commanders around both settlements. Rumors from grizzled hunters and outriders who patrol THE WASTES claim that UGLUK and THE RED HORDE worship the orc god Bel’Mog, who demands the complete subjugation of the continent. If true, this would mean total war is indeed coming to the four great houses. Though they are preoccupied with the games of power and intrigue among their own rivalries, there are lesser nobles in each house who recognize the existential threat that THE HORDE poses should they launch an all-out siege on their civilization. Some even say that some of the brash rogue nobility of HOUSE MERIA has sought to buy off the more receptive orc and giant warlords promising them vast riches in exchange for their hordes in house warfare…

Power Rating: 3/10
Alignment: Mixed Neutral/Good

THE SOUL WASHERS
Power Rating: unknown
Alignment: True Neutral
Leader: Master Waja [dragonborn samurai]

Alignment: Chaotic Good
Leader: Hralfgar the Black [dwarven barbarian]
A notorious minor clan of dwarven barbarians patrolling the mountains around THANE’S HOLD whose sole purpose is to die gloriously in battle. High King THANOR sees their antics as a brutal and unnecessary part of the defense of his people, and yet grudgingly accepts their aid whenever it arrives, always at the last moment of battle. HRALFGAR THE BLACK is infamous among the orcs of THE WASTES for taking heads and keeping score of his slain…

AVATAR OF HERONIMUS
Race and class: Human Warlock
Known equipment: The Nightwand
HQ: Tower of Nejune
Alignment: Lawful Evil
Tier: Avatar

Radically opposed to any treaty or open pact with the other houses, Magus Gor’s rule of HOUSE NEJUNE has been one of intense pride in their isolationist stance. Bearing a deep hatred of HOUSE DARGO and a lurking fear to match of THE INQUISITION, he is considered by the other nobles to be paranoid at best, insane at worst. A huge proponent of the slave and magical artifact trade of his house. Though not publicly confirmed by any authority of the realm, he is rumored to have made terrible pacts with the denizens of The Outer Planes. He attained his rank of Magus 35 years ago in the lawless lands of NEJUNE when he slew the previous title-bearer by summoning ferocious planar horrors. His most fearsome tool is the legendary Nightwand, an arcane tool of eldritch power able to command the legions of undead who slumber in the dark forests and swamps on his realm.

His right hand man is the notorious mage known as NEBULOS. He is a wanted man in both DARGO and AETHERIUS noble houses for several suspected murders though he has faced no trial due to political favors. His control of the lucrative artifact trade in NEJUNE is often ridiculed due to the amount of alleged cursed and counterfeit items exported. His own crafting work, the Orb of Fear is an item that warps the primal fears and twists the minds of his unfortunate victims. Also revealed to hold one of the three legendary Daggers of Heronimus, an evil cursed black & red dagger that banishes the souls of those it kills.

Faction: CLAN THORGREM

High King Thanor  
MISSING IN ACTION
Race and class: Dwarf Battlemaster
Known equipment: Axe of Thane
HQ: Thane’s Hold
Alignment: Lawful Good
Tier: S+

At over 500 years old, High King Thanor is one of the few dwarves who recalls the glory days of CLAN THORGREM when their military and economic might peaked in AETERNUM. He is beloved both by his own people as well as the independent factions of the north due to his honor, dignity, nobility, and stubborn defense of all that is good. His people have suffered the most at the hands of THE RED HORDE, and because of this he has been forced to rally every able-bodied dwarf for war. Due to the trade routes south to the four great houses responsible for their considerable wealth, THANE’S HOLD must defend every mile of their lands and the High King sees to this. His brilliant tactics and feats include the personal slaying of the previous most powerful ogre warlord “Eolg Bonetooth” in a decisive battle over 200 years ago. He wields the most potent runic weapon of his people the Axe of Thane, said to have been passed down from Thane himself during the dawn era on AETERNUM. This greataxe is unbelievably heavy to the touch and can crush solid stone with a single swing, though what runic enchantments it possesses is a well kept dwarven runesmith secret.



Hralfgar the Black  
MISSING IN ACTION
Race and class: Dwarf Barbarian
Known equipment: Slayer’s Gauntlet 
HQ: The Gray Wastes
Alignment: Chaotic Good
Tier: S

Covered in ornate black tattoos head to toe and heavily muscled, Hralfgar the Black is a fearsome sight even among the gruff and veteran dwarven warriors. He fearlessly leads THE SLAYERWATCH into battle in order to win a glorious death in war, the only oath they uphold. He is something of an exile and outcast among his clan, not having set foot within THANE’S HOLD for over 80 years. His band of battle-crazed slayers roam THE GRAY WASTES and slay all evil races they come upon. Hralfgar is rightly feared by the bestial tribes of the Wastes due his penchant for taking the heads of his enemies no matter the cost. He and High King Thanor have a tenuous relationship at best, though each has come to the other’s aid countless times in dire battles. He wields the runic artifact known as the Slayer’s Gauntlet, an armor piece he can never remove while he lives. It grants him a bloodlust and combat frenzy that saps his own lifeforce in exchange for wild feats of savage strength.



Master Dagga Ironpalm 
MISSING IN ACTION
Race and class: Dwarf Monk
Known equipment: Ring of Sun Iron 
HQ: Thane’s Hold
Alignment: Neutral Good
Tier: A

Master Dagga Ironpalm has a reputation among his hold for being one of the wisest and most far-seeing dwarves in the High King’s council. Personal bodyguard to the dwarven nobles and sometimes even diplomat for his people, this skilled monk is both feared and respected among the other houses. On matters of war, he suspects that THANE’S HOLD and THE GRAY GATE will soon fall under UGLUK THE RED’S onslaught if the four houses do not unite against them. He is the primary voice preaching that the High King should withdraw into their deeps and allow the haughty nobles of AETHERIUS and DARGO to be forced to act. He wears the Ring of Sun Iron, a holy relic that inspires the hearts and minds of all who stand in his presence. It also allows his fearsome palms to blaze with holy light that is anathema to the creatures of the Underdark as well as the undead.

He has held the Seal of Thane for several centuries which marks him as the guildmaster of the entire hold and also a major political noble of his house.

Trader captain and seasoned merchant guild member reporting to JURIN met on the road by the fellowship traveling to MERIA with his caravan. Claims to be old friends with BRORNOR from when he knew him 100 years ago before he left the hold. The party later learns that their history goes back to when they were tasked with a rival trade contract that BRAX won out on, shaming BRORNOR and having something to do with him deciding to leave his clan to make his home in MERIA… Invited Zadshen and the party to be sworn guild mercenaries inside the hold should they close their gates.

Faction: THE RED HORDE

Ugluk the Red  
AVATAR OF BEL’MOG
Race and class: Orc Barbarian
Known equipment: The Skull Blade
HQ: Somewhere in the Gray Mountains
Alignment: Chaotic Evil
Tier: S+

Now having either crushed or united most of the beastly tribes of THE GRAY WASTES over the past decades, Ugluk the Red has amassed his hordes of war and has begun his siege on the north. Little is known about his origins or even his abilities in battle, for none have faced him and lived to tell the tale. The few brash rangers and outriders who patrol the northlands claim that he was born to his orc tribe with red skin, a prophetic omen of their conquering god Bel’Mog. Because of this he is almost seen as a religious leader to the orc and goblin shamans who now call for an all-out war on the continent ending in the complete slaughter, subjugation, and enslavement of the goodly races. Ugluk has not yet appeared in open battle, and yet presumably he now commands the increasingly dangerous marauding orc warbands assaulting trade routes as well as the hunter-killer hobgoblin squads conducting night raids upon the north.



Tauren Rockbreaker  
Race and class: Stone Giant Berserker 
Known equipment: Bone Mace of Gorg
HQ: Somewhere in the Gray Mountains
Alignment: Chaotic Evil
Tier: S

Seen as the unofficial “king” of the giant and ogre clans in The Gray Mountains, Tauren Rockbreaker has a terrible reputation for eating traders and merchants alive who dare pass through his clan hunting grounds. Little else is known about him and his clans as few have actually faced him in battle and returned. Rumor has it that though he has begrudgingly agreed to serve in Ugluk’s vanguard, that the two hate one another. Apparently he wields the Bone Mace of Gorg, a gargantuan and unwieldy magical weapon that causes the wearer to slowly become insane.









Ku’ulgan Mosshide  
Race and class: Troll Savage Druid 
Known equipment: Skullmuncha
HQ: Somewhere in the Gray Wastes
Alignment: Neutral Evil
Tier: S

A renowned shaman and druid among the savage races of THE GRAY WASTES, Ku’ulgan Mosshide is supposedly partially behind Ugluk’s rise to power. His extremely old age for a troll combined with his fetid powers of trance make him respected among those he does not kill or eat. He carries a small magical fetish called Skullmuncha which speaks to him in his mind, sharing portents and battlefield tactics when commanding his troll clans. 




Gauorezz Nightstalker  
Race and class: Hobgoblin Scout 
Known equipment: Neckchoppa
HQ: Somewhere in the Gray Wastes
Alignment: Lawful Evil
Tier: A

This hobgoblin captain commands the growing ranks of the hunter-killer squads that now terrorize the nightwatches of the north. It is unclear whether he is under direct orders from Ugluk the Red. Gauorezz Nightstalker demands brutal loyalty from the regiments of hobgoblin, kobold, goblin, and gnoll serving under him. Disobedience means death. His short sword Neckchoppa has silenced several lower commanders among the dwarven, elven, and human military companies traversing THE GRAY WASTES already.

He aptly wields the red twin Drakwald Daggers to great effect both in dual-wielding melee and also in lethal precision throws.

Some whisper that she wishes to become a demi-god by becoming the Avatar of Alaya. There is gossip that Mistraya and Aenarion have formerly been lovers. Her holy powers stem from the brilliant wondrous white relic the Robes of Alaya, rumored to grant her true immortality and even the ability to planeswalk.

Cicero Windblade

Known equipment: Tempest
HQ: Fort Bane
Alignment: Lawful Evil
Tier: S+

Perhaps one of the most dangerous & mysterious men in AETERNUM, Cicero Windblade has risen to complete dominance of THE ARKEN COMPANY through his meticulous war strategy. Being the most sought after and profitable mercenary company among the four great houses, Cicero has ensured that ARKEN COMPANY assassins, thieves, and spies are held to the most rigorous standards of skill and loyalty. His lieutenants dare not question his order on pain of death. Rumor has it that he is either a member or even bound by “THE GUILD” and/or HOUSE MERIA itself. Due to their centuries old independent contracts and political immunities, THE ARKEN COMPANY is able to operate with utter impunity when hired. Politically it is said that his leadership will spell eventual doom for the line of HOUSE DARGO as he secretly plots their annihilation. Cicero himself claims he does not actively lead missions anymore despite slaying many renowned heroes of the past in deadly duels, the most famous of which being the former HOUSE DARGO High Templar Seren. His favorite weapon Tempest is rumored to actually be a legendary blade from MAGUS RISE possessed by a Storm Djinn. Those that have watched him fight claim that the blade itself does not actually cut his foes but rather the galeforce winds constantly surrounding its keen edge.

His ability to instantly perceive a complex battlefield at a glance is largely why he is brought into war council chambers for a hefty price. Boreas is said to be the son of an AETHERIUS noble though he denies this claim. Is known for his custom eye-patch, worn after he lost his left eye in a duel with Cicero himself.
