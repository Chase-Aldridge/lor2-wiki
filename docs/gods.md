# The Pantheon of LOR

## The Three Titans of Creation

The first beings that incarnated in the multiverse, who then created the planes, the planet LOR, and all the other gods.

### Exarian, the Titan of Light

First and oldest of the Titans, created light and matter itself. Has never been described or seen in all the annals of the ancient elves and dwarves of LOR. Believed to sit atop his own plane above all creation writing in THE WORLDTOME, a book of metareality that already contains past, present, and future.

**Status:** Mythological
**Domain:** Light, Matter, Creation
**Plane:** Unknown (Above All Creation)

### Kronus, Titan of Time

Second and darkest of the Titans, created temporality and mortality itself. Worshipped by some factions within the MAGISTERIUM and some planar cults who hope to curry his dark favor.

His dark avatar was summoned and then miraculously banished by the "fatetouched" of The Rusitauri during the Aeternum Crisis of 1111AE, nearly trapping the continent into a deathly magical stasis.

**Influence:** Chiefly worshiped by Magisterium
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil
**Domain:** Death, Knowledge, Arcana
**Weapon:** Magic
**Colors:** Pure Black
**Offerings:** Time, lifespan, blood
**Plane:** Unknown

### Alariel, Titan of Magic

Third and youngest of the Titans, created the weave and winds of magic and spellcraft in its primordial form.

Was key in helping her older brother Exarian in creating the various pantheons of gods to rule over their domains, while also protecting them from the devouring appetite of Kronus. She has many forms and names in every culture, and yet her planar intercessions are rare.

**Status:** Mythological
**Domain:** Magic, The Weave
**Plane:** Unknown

## The Demigods of Aeternum (Dawn Era)

The original pantheon of demigods born from mortals during the dawn era on AETERNUM:

- **Lokhir** - Lost power and influence, went silent in 1112AE
- **Alaya** - Lost power and influence, went silent in 1112AE
- **Heronmius** - Lost power and influence, went silent in 1112AE
- **Bel'Mog** - Lost power and influence, went silent in 1112AE
- **Oberon** - Power broken in the Fey Court, hold on FEYWILD ended 1111AE
- **Leira** - Lost power and influence, went silent in 1112AE

Many scholars theorize this was the ultimate effect of the winds of magic being sealed and then released again during the "end times" events when Kronus was banished from the Material Plane.
