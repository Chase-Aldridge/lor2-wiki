## Background

Nynora is a wood elf rogue and stealthy mastermind born in the coastal city of Meria. Her life revolved around the sea, sailing, and her family - until they disappeared under mysterious circumstances.

### Family & The High Seas

Nynora grew up sailing the high seas with her family. They were experienced sailors and merchants who traveled the waters around Aeternum conducting trade and adventure. Her childhood was filled with:
- Sea voyages and maritime adventure
- Learning navigation and sailing
- Trade negotiations and merchant dealings
- The freedom of the open ocean
- Close bonds with her family

### The Mysterious Disappearance

Tragedy struck when Nynora's family was **lost at sea under mysterious circumstances**. The disappearance was connected to their dealings with a figure known only as **'W'** - apparently a member of **The Guild**.

**What is known:**
- Family had business dealings with 'W'
- After these dealings, they vanished at sea
- No bodies recovered, no wreckage found
- Mystery surrounding the true cause

This loss drove Nynora to become a rogue, using stealth and deception to uncover the truth about what happened to her loved ones.

### Letters from 'W'

Throughout her journey with the fellowship, Nynora received mysterious communications from 'W':

**First Letter:**
- Delivered by hawk (just like her father used to receive)
- En route to Meria before Chapter IV
- Reminded her of her father's missives
- Confirmed 'W' was still watching her

**Second Letter (Chapter IV):**
- Written in **Draconic language**
- Actually a coded cipher
- Nynora researched it in Meria's great library
- With help from Archivist Belvas, deciphered the message:
  - **"Nejune moves against Dargo on the Blood Moon"**
- This warning proved crucial to later events
- Blood Moon ritual date: 1111.4AE (two months from receipt)

These letters suggest 'W' had:
- Intimate knowledge of her family
- Access to high-level intelligence
- Interest in larger political movements
- Possible connection to Nynora's fate

## Unresolved Threads

Several plot threads involving Nynora remain open:

1. **Her Current Location** - Where is she now?
2. **Her Mentor's Identity** - Who was she seeking?
3. **'W's' True Identity** - Who is this Guild member?
4. **Family's Fate** - What really happened to them?
5. **The Dealings** - What business did family have with 'W'?
6. **Will She Return?** - Will she rejoin the fellowship?
7. **The Guild's Role** - How does The Guild fit into larger story?

## Theories & Speculation

**Mentor Identity Theories:**
- Could be 'W' themselves
- Another rogue or assassin
- Guild master or operative
- Someone who knew her family
- Red herring leading to trap

**'W' Identity Theories:**
- High-ranking Guild merchant lord
- Oreon himself (Guild leader in Meria)
- Undercover noble from another house
- Former associate of her father
- Someone trying to protect or destroy her

**Return Scenarios:**
- Arrives with Guild forces during critical battle
- Reappears with vital intelligence
- Shows up having infiltrated enemy organization
- Returns changed by her experiences
- Never returns (permanent departure)

## Impact on Fellowship

Nynora's departure affected the party:

**Immediate Effects:**
- Lost a skilled rogue and scout
- Lost mastermind tactical support
- No one to pick locks or disarm traps as expertly
- Lost language skills (especially Orc)
- Lost codebreaking expertise

**Long-term Effects:**
- Made party more combat-heavy
- Reduced stealth capabilities
- Lost connection to Guild information network
- Lost potential intelligence about Nejune (she warned them!)
- Created mystery and unresolved emotional thread

## The Rapier of Mind Change

Her signature weapon deserves special note - a **rare rapier of mind change**. This suggests:
- Magical item affecting victims' thoughts
- Possibly charm or domination effects
- Fits her mastermind/deception role
- Could be key item if she returns
- May be what she's using to survive alone

## Follower of Leira

Nynora follows **Leira, Goddess of Deception and Illusion**. This is highly appropriate for:
- A rogue who deals in secrets
- Someone investigating mysterious disappearances
- A mastermind who uses misdirection
- A follower of coded messages and hidden truths

Leira's influence may guide her path, wherever she is now.

## Final Thoughts

Nynora represents an unfinished story - a companion who chose personal quest over fellowship, secrets over safety, and solo investigation over group strength.

Her warning about the Blood Moon attack proved her intelligence gathering was legitimate. Her departure suggests she knows something the others don't, or is chasing a lead too dangerous to share.

Whether she survived the chaos that has engulfed Aeternum remains unknown.

Whether she will return remains to be seen.

Whether her family's fate will be discovered is still a mystery.

But somewhere in the forests, cities, or shadows of Aeternum, Nynora continues her hunt for the truth about 'W' and the fate of her family.
