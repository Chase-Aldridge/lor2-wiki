## Background

Shorea is a Silver Dragonborn Samurai born in the village of Draconiss. He was trained in the way of Bushido by Master Waja, studying the ancient traditions of dragonborn martial arts and sword mastery. His life was shattered when three demons attacked and destroyed his village and people, leaving him as one of the few survivors.

### The Destruction of Draconiss

Shorea's village was destroyed by three powerful demons, killing his family and fellow villagers. This traumatic event set him on a path of vengeance and justice, driving him to hunt down the demons responsible for the massacre.

### Master Waja

Master Waja was Shorea's mentor and teacher, a legendary samurai who trained him in the ways of Bushido and sword combat. Throughout Shorea's journey, the spirit and memory of Master Waja continues to guide him, appearing in visions and moments of spiritual significance.

## Primary Weapon: Glaw/REN

### Glaw - The Cursed Form

Shorea initially wielded Glaw, a freezing liquid dai-katana. However, the blade was cursed, containing the **Demon of Rage** bound within its steel. Throughout his early adventures, Shorea struggled with the demon's influence, which would attempt to take control of him during combat, driving him into bloodlust and threatening his allies.

### The Demon of Rage

The Demon of Rage was one of three demons bound with three angels in a mystical connection:
- **Demon of Rage** + **Angel of Will** (in Glaw/REN) - Demon dominant initially
- **Demon of Hatred** + **Angel of Knowledge** (in the Tower of Dusk) - Angel dominant but corrupted
- **Demon of Fear** + **Angel of Virtue** (in a Meria galleon) - Equal balance

The demon manifested physically during the journey through the Darkwood (Chapter IX), where Shorea was forced to fight it alongside his companions. Though defeated temporarily, the demon remained bound in the sword.

### REN - The True Name

After a climactic journey to Mount Yordan and a spiritual battle atop the sacred volcano, Shorea cast Glaw into the volcanic fires. In a final confrontation, with the help of his companions (particularly Ulrick's moonbeam spell at a critical moment), Shorea defeated the Demon of Rage once and for all.

Upon purifying the blade, Shorea learned its true name: **REN**. The sword transformed from a cursed weapon into a holy blade blessed by Bahamut himself.

### Shikai and Bankai

Through his spiritual journey and connection with REN, Shorea unlocked the blade's true powers:

**Shikai** - Unlocked after defeating the demon and learning the blade's true name. This represents the first release of REN's power.

**Bankai** - Achieved at the Temple of Bahamut on the Isle of the Dragon (Chapter XXII). In a spiritual vision, Shorea and REN combined their power to help Bahamut defeat Tiamat, banishing the wind of chaos from the temple. This ultimate form represents the full manifestation of REN's divine power.

## Abilities & Fighting Style

### Bushido Mastery
Shorea fully unlocked his Bushido fighting spirit early in his journey (Chapter III), embracing the way of the samurai and its spiritual discipline.
