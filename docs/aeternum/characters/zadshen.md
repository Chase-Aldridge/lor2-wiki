## Background

Zadshen is an Aasimar Paladin born under mysterious circumstances in Dargo. His celestial heritage marks him as special, bearing the blood of angels and carrying a destiny tied to the divine guardians known as the Fallen Angels.

### Origins & Early Life

**Surrogate Fathers:**
- **High Templar Seren** - His first surrogate father (deceased)
- **Cicero Windblade** - His later guardian and mentor

Zadshen was born under mysterious circumstances that remain partially unexplained. His celestial nature manifested early, marking him as an Aasimar with divine purpose.

### The Oath of Vengeance

Early in his life, Zadshen experienced a pivotal moment where he was teleported to the Outlands of the planes (Chapter III). There, he met a vision from Leviathan and swore the **Oath of Vengeance**, dedicating himself to hunting down those who have committed great evils and bringing divine justice.

### The Dragonspear Connection

Zadshen was adopted into or connected to the **Dragonspear bloodline**, one of the most powerful noble houses in Dargo. This lineage includes:
- **Beren Dragonspear** - High Templar and King of Dargo, current ruler
- **Fagren Dragonspear** - Beren's son and heir (later revealed as traitor)
- **Geren** - Beren's bastard son (fell at the Tower of Dawn)

The Dragonspears hold both the crown (kingship) and the military (High Templar position) in Dargo, making them incredibly powerful but also targets of political intrigue.

## Divine Connection: The Fallen Angels

Zadshen's quest revolves around three **Fallen Angels** - celestial guardians who have been bound and corrupted:

### The Three Angel-Demon Pairs

1. **Angel of Will** + Demon of Rage
   - Connected to Shorea's sword REN/Glaw
   - Demon was dominant initially
   - Angel has been aiding Shorea from the shadows
   - Spiritually linked to Zadshen's fate

2. **Angel of Knowledge** + Demon of Hatred
   - Bound in the **Tower of Dusk** in Aetherius
   - Angel is dominant but corrupted
   - One of Zadshen's primary quests is to free this angel

3. **Angel of Virtue** + Demon of Fear
   - Located in a Meria galleon in the north sea
   - In equal balance between angel and demon
   - Status unknown after fall of Meria

### Visions from Leviathan

Throughout his journey, Zadshen receives visions and guidance from Leviathan:

**Early Visions (Chapter III-IV):**
- Shown clues about the first fallen angel leading into the Fellwood
- Given a "ping" of location approximately 200 miles to the east

**Chapter VI:**
- Rode off solo into the woods following another vision
- Updated information on the fallen angels' whereabouts

**Chapter XIII:**
- Shown the link between angel souls and demon souls through metaphor
- Witnessed ancient vision of Celestials grasping forearms in alliance with House Aetherius
- Shown a vision of a celestial kingdom spanning the continent, bringing peace
- Warned of consequences if he fails: Meria falls in flames, the Red Horde descends on Aetherius
- Learned about **The Qunari** - ancient order his bloodline has ties to

**Chapter XIX (Mount Yordan):**
- Communed with his blade, learned its will to only battle the strongest
- Made "the leap of faith" from the volcano
- Learned how to become Champion of Leviathan (requires 1000 followers, a cleric, and a paladin)
- Received blessing but not yet champion status
- Learned about the Dragon War and his role in it

**Chapter XXII (The King Wish):**
- After wishing to become King of Dargo, visited by massive faceless black and white angel
- **Warned that he chose earthly kingship over divine sanction from The Qunari**
- **BANNED from entering the Seven Heavenly Planes**
- Received a falling star scar on his chest
- Leviathan confirmed he is ally to The Qunari, but fate has been altered

## The Qunari

An ancient celestial order that Zadshen's bloodline has connections to. They apparently had a pact or destiny planned for Zadshen, which he violated by using the Luck Blade to wish for mortal kingship. The consequences of this choice have marked him permanently.

## Major Equipment

### Primary Weapons
- **Holy Amulet of Leviathan** - His primary divine focus
- **Moonsilver Javelin** - Used to create holy water in Saint Bel'raa's tomb
- **Various blessed weapons** - Obtained throughout journey

### Legendary Items

**The Luck Blade** - Found during adventures, contained a single Wish spell. Zadshen used this to make "The King Wish" (see below).

**The Helm of the Ironbreaker** - Purchased from The Collector in Dargo's underworld.

**Fireborne** - Acquired from The Collector in trade for Paindrinker.

### Other Equipment
- Belt of Hill Giant Strength
- Black iron ring of constitution
- Various +1 moon-touched weapons
- Artifacts from Alaya's apostles

## Abilities & Powers

### Celestial Heritage
- **Angelic Wings** - Can sprout glowing angelic wings for flight and intimidation
- **Celestial Resistance** - Natural resistance to divine and necrotic energies
- **Divine Sense** - Can detect good, evil, and divine presences

### Paladin Powers
- **Lay on Hands** - Divine healing touch (saved Ulrick's life multiple times)
- **Divine Smite** - Devastating blessed attacks
- **Protection from Good and Evil** - Magical ward against charm and domination
- **Detect Thoughts** - Can read surface thoughts (used on Earl Carth)
- **Find Steed** - Summons celestial mount (transformed to summon celestial dire wolf)

## The King Wish - A Fate Changed

In Chapter XXII, after defeating the Golden Order forces on the beach of the Isle of the Dragon, Zadshen made a decision that would alter his destiny forever.

### The Wish

Using the **Luck Blade**, Zadshen wished: **"I wish to have Beren abdicate his throne and make me King of Dargo as the most powerful heir available."**

The moment he spoke the wish:
- Massive peal of thunderous lightning crashed in the background
- The fabric of fate itself shifted
- He felt... nothing (initially)

### The Consequences

**Immediate:**
- Sent message to Beren, who responded with ire calling him "usurper"
- No formal recognition or throne transfer occurred
- Political chaos in Dargo over succession

**Divine Punishment:**
- Visited by a massive faceless black and white angel
- Informed he chose earthly kingship over divine sanction
- **BANNED from the Seven Heavenly Planes for eternity**
- Marked with a falling star scar on his chest
- Broke unknown pact with The Qunari

**Status:**
- Claims kingship but lacks recognition
- Beren still rules from power
- Other nobles divided in loyalty
- "Climbing Silver" faction uncertain of his claim

### Theological Implications

Leviathan confirmed that Zadshen is still an ally to The Qunari, and his mission regarding the Dragon War remains valid. However, by choosing mortal power over divine destiny, he has fundamentally altered his fate and lost access to the heavenly realms.

This represents a tragic character choice - gaining earthly power at the cost of his celestial heritage and divine destiny.

## Character Development

Zadshen's arc is one of destiny versus choice, divine purpose versus mortal ambition:

1. **Divine Calling** - Born with celestial purpose, marked for greatness
2. **The Quest** - Seeking fallen angels, serving Leviathan faithfully
3. **Growing Power** - Rising through battles and proving himself
4. **Political Awareness** - Revealing Dragonspear lineage, entering politics
5. **The Temptation** - Finding the Luck Blade and its Wish
6. **The Fall** - Choosing mortal kingship over divine destiny
7. **The Consequences** - Banned from heaven, marked as usurper, fate altered
8. **The Unknown** - What does it mean to be a king rejected by both heaven and earth?

His tragedy is choosing power in the moment without understanding the eternal cost. He gained a crown he cannot wear and lost heaven itself.
