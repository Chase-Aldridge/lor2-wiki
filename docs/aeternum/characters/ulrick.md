## Background

Ulrick Blaze was born during a violent lightning storm in a small community deep within the Fellwood. This prophetic birth marked him as special from the beginning, touched by nature's fury and power.

### The Village & Family

Ulrick grew up in a small Fellwood community, raised by his family including his beloved sister. His childhood was peaceful until tragedy struck.

### Lord Tartulien's Massacre

**Lord Tartulien**, a baron of House Aetherius, attacked Ulrick's village and massacred his family, including his sister. This traumatic event set Ulrick on a path of vengeance and shaped his entire worldview.

The injustice of a noble using power to destroy innocent lives in the forest became the defining wound of Ulrick's life.

### Training with Thalindra

After the massacre, [Thalindra](/docs/aeternum/npcs/thalindra) found and trained young Ulrick. She was a powerful druid and spiritual leader from the village of Oakenleaf. She taught him about:
- The balance between nature and civilization
- The ways of Silvanus, the nature god
- Combat and survival skills
- The Oath of the Ancients

Thalindra became a mother figure to Ulrick, filling the void left by his family's murder.

## The Dual Path: Paladin & Warlock

### Oath of the Ancients (Silvanus)

Early in his journey (Chapter III), Ulrick took the **Oath of the Ancients**, swearing to:
- Protect the natural world
- Preserve the light and beauty in the world
- Bring balance between nature and civilization
- Serve Silvanus, the nature god

His oath was symbolized by a **crystal pendant of protection** that Thalindra had given him, which was later magically enhanced during their final all-night vigil together.

### The Fey Pact (Oberon)

During the journey through the Fellwood (Chapter VI-VII), Ulrick's hunger for power to avenge his family led him down a dangerous path. He began seeking arcane knowledge and eventually made contact with **Oberon, King of the Feywild**.

**The Bargain:**
- Ulrick gave his service to Oberon in exchange for warlock powers
- Received Little Leaf, a fey sprite familiar
- Gained access to potent fey magic and wild magic
- Tasked with missions to serve Oberon's interests

**The Price:**
- Separated from Silvanus (could no longer commune properly)
- Suffered physical consequences from wild magic surges
- Moral degradation and increasingly violent actions
- Aging and physical transformation

## Little Leaf

Little Leaf is Ulrick's fey sprite familiar, given to him by Oberon as part of their pact. This invisible fey creature serves as:
- Scout and spy (used extensively for reconnaissance)
- Messenger
- Combat support
- Connection to the Feywild

Little Leaf has proven invaluable for scouting enemy positions, carrying magical items, and even participating in the legendary "Bean 9/11" operations.

## The Descent into Darkness

### Chapter IX - "Darkness Tests the Fellowship"

Ulrick's moral decline began in earnest during the journey through the Shadowlands:

**The Mercenary Massacre:**
- Encountered Captain Gorn and The Bone Company (mercenaries)
- Cast **modify memory** on the captain, charmed him
- His lips exploded with plagueborn wild magic
- Spell killed his horse instantly in acid plume
- **Unleashed wild magic sunburst, burning and blinding the soldiers**
- **Systematically massacred the entire camp with the party**
- Cast modify memory again, psychically destroying the captain's mind
- Grew over 10 feet tall from wild magic
- **Zadshen punched him in the solar plexus to bring him to senses**

**The Confession:**
- Broke down in tears, admitted the pact with Oberon
- Shared his confusion, sadness, and lust for power
- In moment of crisis, saw Thalindra's face in his pendant's reflection
- **Witnessed Thalindra drawing her last breath in Fellwood Watch**
- Oberon congratulated him on using his powers, demanded contact before next dawn

**Consequences:**
- Arca and Zadshen questioned his lawless violence
- Deep wedge driven between the fellowship
- Dark tension colored the party going forward

### Chapter X - "Ulrick Falls"

The nadir of Ulrick's descent came with a catastrophic choice:

**The Aetherius Caravan Attack:**
- Encountered Aetherius merchant caravan on the road
- Enraged by insult to Shorea from the soldiers
- **Mad with power, called upon wild fey magic**
- Brought down holy flames in dawnburst around them
- **Instantly killed their horses, seared the men with blinding fire**
- **RAPIDLY AGED OVER 18 YEARS as spell left his lips**

**His Secondhand Wand Explodes:**
- Wand of fireball malfunctioned
- Showered him and Shorea in flames

**The Battle:**
- Noble blasted party with his wand of fireball
- Ulrick used wand of web and cloudkill scroll
- Party trapped in desperate melee

**The Death:**
- Ulrick fell unconscious from great spear assault
- Surrounded, isolated, bleeding out
- **SLAIN before companions' eyes by Aetherius soldier**
- **Spear driven through his skull**
- Party fell into despair

**Divine Intervention:**
- **Arca called upon ALAYA for divine intervention**
- **Goddess grasped Ulrick's soul**
- **RESURRECTED him, wounds magically knitting**
- Left with grievous scar
- **Saw his life review in death**
- **Witnessed Oberon's consternation and Alaya's grace**
- Body physically weakened, lifeforce sapped

**Aftermath:**
- Found Lord Felor's estate documents and contracts
- Recovered huge hoard of dwarven and human craftwork
- Party humbled by brush with permanent death

## Wild Magic & Physical Transformation

Ulrick's use of fey magic came with severe consequences through wild magic surges:

**Physical Changes:**
- **Aged over 18 years** (Chapter X - from attacking caravan)
- **Hair turned long, thin, and stark white** (Chapter XIII)
- **Lips exploded with plagueborn wild magic, covered in blight signs** (Chapter IX)
- **Grew over 10 feet tall** (Chapter IX - temporary)
- **Skin turned rotting and undead-like, turning blue** (Chapter XXII)
- **Exploded with plague pus from mouth** (Chapter XXII)
- **Shrank almost two feet** (Chapter XIX - fighting Neerius)

**Magical Side Effects:**
- Summoned unwanted creatures (unicorn, giant fey banana)
- Created blinding horrors and fears
- Unleashed devastating uncontrolled damage
- Aged several more years throughout adventures

By the end of his arc, Ulrick bears little physical resemblance to the young man who left the Fellwood.

## Oberon's Missions

Throughout the campaign, Oberon gave Ulrick specific tasks:

**Mission 1: Nebulos (Chapter IX-X)**
- Eliminate or severely disenfranchise a man with a long black scar in Nejune
- Target identified as Nebulos, right hand to Yon'Tal
- Mission accomplished when Yon'Tal's villa was destroyed

**Mission 2: Dragon Tooth (Chapter XVI)**

- Ancient white dragon living atop frozen peaks of Gray Mountains
- Required for unknown fey ritual or purpose

**Mission 3: Alliance & Portal (Chapter XVII+)**
- Broker alliance between Feywild and Fellwood leaders
- Create permanent portal between planes
- Ulrick would become the bridge between worlds

**Overall Goal:**
Oberon wants Nejune to cede territory and be weakened. He cares not who wins the war, only that Nejune loses ground to nature and the Fey.

## Redemption & Ascension

### Chapter XIX - Mount Yordan

After helping Shorea defeat the Demon of Rage, Ulrick prayed to Silvanus. Though the nature god could not speak to him audibly (due to the Oberon pact), Silvanus showed him visions:

**Vision 1:** Timeline where Fellwood Watch allies with Feywild to defend the forests successfully

**Vision 2:** Timeline where the forests burn as the Red Horde overruns the defenders if he fails

**The Calling:** Ulrick could become the bridge between the two powers.

## Character Development

Ulrick's journey is one of the most tragic and complex in the fellowship:

2. **Vengeful Student** - Trained by Thalindra, took Oath of Ancients
3. **The Hunger** - Sought more power to achieve revenge
4. **The Pact** - Bargained with Oberon, gained warlock powers
5. **The Descent** - Increasingly violent and morally compromised actions
6. **The Death** - Killed, resurrected, humbled by mortality
7. **The Transformation** - Physically and magically changed by wild magic
8. **The Ascension** - Became Champion of Oberon, bridged two worlds
9. **The Sacrifice** - Used Wish scroll to save companions, may never cast Wish again

His arc asks: How much of yourself do you sacrifice for power? At what point does the tool of revenge become the master?

## Physical Description

**Original Appearance:**

**Bridge** - Literally becomes connection between two worlds (Feywild/Fellwood)

**Death & Rebirth** - Died and was resurrected, fundamentally changed

**Duality** - Paladin oath vs warlock pact, Silvanus vs Oberon, nature vs fey

## Notable Quotes

"I just want the power to avenge my family." - His driving motivation

"The forests will burn if I fail." - Understanding his role as bridge

## Goals

- ~~Broker alliance between Feywild and Fellwood~~ (In progress)
- Create permanent portal between planes
- Kill or weaken Nejune for Oberon
- Eventually confront Lord Tartulien for family's murder
- Master the wild magic he's been cursed/blessed with
- Fulfill role as Champion of Oberon
- Find balance between his dual nature
- Protect the Fellwood from destruction

## The Tragic Hero

Ulrick represents the cost of vengeance and power. Every gain came with a price:
- Gained warlock powers → Lost Silvanus
- Gained fey magic → Lost youth and appearance
- Gained Champion status → Lost innocence and mortality
- Gained Wish → Lost ability to Wish again
- Gained intelligence → Lost humanity

He achieved his goal of becoming powerful enough to face his enemies, but the question remains: Is he still the person who wanted that revenge? Or has he become something else entirely?
