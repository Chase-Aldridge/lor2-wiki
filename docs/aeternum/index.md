# Aeternum

## The Continent

Our adventurers find themselves embroiled in the drama of one major continent where they were born in the world of LOR: **AETERNUM**. Recorded history here begins over 1,000 years ago (0AE), founded with the first elves and dwarves. The current year is **1111AE**.

The people of AETERNUM have **not had contact with any other continents of LOR for over 300 years**. Magical mists encircle the continent, impenetrable from within or without. The mist is unnatural, created for unknown reasons - whether to protect or to trap remains one of the great mysteries.
