# Aeternum - The Continent in Crisis

## Welcome to the Aeternum Wiki

This wiki documents the epic D&D 5th edition campaign "The Aeternum Crisis" - the tale of The Fellowship of the Blade (also known as "The Rúsitauri" or "The Sons of the Forest") and their struggle to save the continent of Aeternum from total destruction in the year 1111AE.

## The World: LOR

**LOR** is the planet and world where our story unfolds. Tales and myths have been told about the formation of the world by the gods since the birth of the younger races. Various dogmas and schools of thought exist as far as timelines and metaphysical truths are concerned, however the reality is no one really knows.

This world is presumably full of nations and empires of all the major races. Including those from beyond the Material Plane, creatures of all types inhabit LOR - a vast super-continental and oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known (the planet is about **130% larger than Earth**).

## The Continent: AETERNUM

### The Mysterious Isolation

Our adventurers find themselves embroiled in the drama of one major continent where they were born in the world of LOR: **AETERNUM**.

**Recorded History:**
- Begins over 1,000 years ago (0AE)
- Founded with the first elves and dwarves
- Current year: **1111AE**

### The Mist

Interestingly, the people of AETERNUM have **not had contact with any of the other continents of LOR for over 300 years** [since around 800AE]. Curiously, no one is truly aware of why and have generally stopped asking.

**House Aetherius's Explanation:**
- The strongest house militarily has assured citizens
- That **magical mists encircling the continent are impenetrable**
- From within or without
- Whether through shipping lanes or even magical means

**The Truth:**
The mist is unnatural, created for unknown reasons. Whether to:
- Keep the continent isolated and protected from something outside
- Or trap and keep the peoples of Aeternum in solitude
- Remains one of the great mysteries

The Prophecy of Alaya and ancient knowledge held by Mistraya and Fayrus suggest the mist is connected to Aetherius and has deep significance to the fate of the continent.

### A Unique Situation

This isolation has led to a very traditional history of repression and yet a **culturally unique situation** on the continent:
- Men, elves, dwarves, orcs, goblins, and fouler races
- Generally vying for power over the rich but limited natural resources
- Of their massive island

## The Ultimate Question

As the avatars rise and the celestial events approach, Aeternum faces its ultimate question:

**Will the continent:**
1. Be destroyed in cataclysm by the avatars of evil?
2. Ascend to become its own plane under the avatars of good?
3. Find some middle path through the actions of heroes?

**The fellowship must decide:**
- Fight the Red Horde?
- Assault Nejune and stop Magus Gor?
- Investigate Aetherius and the Mist?
- Evacuate the elves as Alaya commanded?
- Unite the fractured houses?
- All of the above?

The clock ticks toward the next celestial event.

The End Times have begun.

The fate of Aeternum hangs in the balance.
