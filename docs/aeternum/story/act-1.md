**Location:** [The Laughing Dragon](/docs/aeternum/locations/laughing-dragon) tavern in [Meria](/docs/aeternum/locations/meria)
**Party Level:** 1

### The Fellowship Forms

Five unlikely heroes find themselves gathered around pints of ale in the famous tavern in Meria, THE LAUGHING DRAGON:

- **[Shorea the Liquid Swordsman](/docs/aeternum/characters/sho)** - A silver dragonborn samurai seeking vengeance for his destroyed village
- **[Ulrick Blaze](/docs/aeternum/characters/ulrick)** - A wild human paladin from deep in the Fellwood, seeking revenge for his murdered family

### The Barkeep's Offer

The venerable dwarven barkeep **[Brornor Battlehand](/docs/aeternum/npcs/brornor-battlehand)** approaches the group with two dangerous mercenary jobs. The party considers the offers over their ale and the entertainment of the famous gnome bard in residence, **[Gromwinston the Garrulous](/docs/aeternum/npcs/gromwinston)**.

The party generously tips Gromwinston before retiring for the night.

### Night Assassination

That very night, the fragile peace is shattered. The party must fend off an insidious assassination attempt by ninja operatives of **THE GOLDEN ORDER**.

This attack reveals:
- Shorea is being actively hunted
- The Golden Order has found them already
- Their meeting may not be as random as it seemed
- Danger follows this group

### The First Contract

The next day, the fellowship makes for the western reaches of **The Gray Hills** to hunt a certain wanted goblin scouting party - their first contract from Brornor.

### First Blood

In the early hours of the morning, they engage a small pack of goblin cutthroats and triumph. Through battle and fellowship, they slowly learn more about one another's fighting styles and capabilities.

This first shared combat begins to forge the bonds that will define them as a fellowship.

---

## Chapter II: "The First Hunt"

**Date:** 1111.1AE
**Location:** The Gray Hills, The North Road
**Party Level:** 2

### The North Road

The fellowship continues their goblin hunt north-northeast along **THE NORTH ROAD** leading from Meria to Thane's Hold.

### The Attacked Caravan

On the road, they encounter an **AETHERIUS trade caravan** that had been attacked by ogres, losing two guards. Speaking with the surviving soldiers, they gain crucial news:

**Intel Gathered:**
- **THE GRAY GATE is under attack** and calling for aid
- The soldiers warn that the Gray Hills are dangerous for travelers
- The caravan guards are wary of the adventuring party
- Tensions are clearly rising in the region

### Ogre & Kobold Encounters

Continuing along the path:
- They slay a wounded ogre left from the caravan attack
- Make camp for the night
- A surviving, bleeding Aetherius soldier comes to their campfire for aid
- They help him and he thanks them before departing to catch up with his comrades

Further along the hilly way, they encounter **kobolds looting a dwarven trade captain's body**. They dispatch the kobolds and discover:
- The captain's entire trade company had been decimated along the roadside
- Reading the merchant guild contract reveals this unfortunate trade convoy from Thane's Hold
- **The convoy had been turned back by agents of House Meria**
- This hints at growing tensions and economic warfare between the houses

### The Cave Entrance

By nightfall, they reach the entrance to a cave mouth marked on their contract map. They engage a band of **goblin warriors camped in front** bearing **the mark of "The Red Hand"**.

**Tactical Victory:**
- They ambush and defeat the goblins
- Lay in wait for any stragglers outside the cave entrance
- Slay the **orc boss** and remaining goblins attempting to flee
- Prepared to delve into the dark cavern

### Into the Depths

Slowly, our party enters the small dark cavern, guided by:
- Darkvision (for those who possess it)
- Torches
- Light-enchanted rocks

**The Eastern Path:**
- They choose to head down the eastern path
- Delve deep under the earth
- Eventually emerge into a sizable natural cavern

### The Bugbear Ambush

Inside the natural cavern, they encounter a pack of sleeping **bugbears**:
- Successfully ambush the creatures
- Awaken some in the fight
- Handily defeat all the bugbears

### The Cache Discovery

In the cavern, they discover stored caches containing:
- **Weapons** - Various armaments
- **Food** - Provisions for a long-term operation
- **Medicine** - Healing supplies
- **Raw ore** - Unprocessed metal
- **Ammunition** - Arrows, bolts, and throwing weapons
- **Gathered loot** - Stolen goods from raids

This cache reveals the goblins and orcs are operating a sophisticated supply operation, not just random raiders.

### The Underground Pool

Hearing only the dripping echo of the deep underground pool at the center of the cave chamber, our party pauses in the depth of night to plot their next moves.

**Chapter End Cliffhanger:**
- Deep underground in enemy territory
- Surrounded by darkness and echoing water
- Unknown threats potentially lurking in other tunnels
- The Red Hand operation is larger than expected

---

## Chapter III: "Meria's Code"

**Date:** 1111.1AE
**Location:** Red Hand Cave, The North Road, Meria
**Party Level:** 3

### The Mysterious Disappearance

As the fellowship catches their breath in the darkness of the cave, something extraordinary happens:

**Zadshen's Divine Calling:**
- The aasimar paladin suddenly drops into a meditative position
- **Vanishes in a *blip* of sparkling blue light**
- Little do they know, he was teleported into **the Outlands of the planes**
- There, he meets a vision from **Leviathan**
- **Swears an Oath of Vengeance**
- Returns to the Material Plane

### The Fellowship Powers Up

Before setting out further, the remaining party members experience growth and transformation:

**Class Progressions:**
- **Ulrick Blaze** - Steels himself and takes the **Oath of Ancients**
- **Nynora** - Adopts the cunning mantle of **Mastermind**
- **Shorea** - Fully unlocks his **Bushido fighting spirit**

Unsure of what just transpired with Zadshen, the group decides to double back up the rotten ladder and return to the main forked path near the cave entrance.

### The Left Path

Heading down the left path, they:
- Come to a curved earthen-hewn staircase
- Spot dim light ahead

**Nynora's Scouting:**
- The rogue stealthily scouts ahead
- Spots a **goblin camp of dark-skinned brutes**
- Led by what appears to be a **goblin shaman** with bone and feather headdress

### The Goblin Ambush

**Tactical Execution:**
- Attracting the party with Orish mimic-speech
- The fellowship quickly slaughters the group
- Uses a **well-placed smoke bomb** in the choke point at the top of the stairs
- Highly effective tactical combat

**The Shaman's Escape:**
- The shaman flees deeper into the cavern after exhausting his magic:
  - Illusory magic
  - Veil of fog
- Dies to an arrow at the last moment as he unleashes his final trick

### The Troll

The dying shaman's last act is to release a **caged troll**:
- The hobbled and mutated beast rushes them
- Cut down by well-placed sword strikes
- Seared to a crisp by magical flames
- Before the beast's cut limbs can regenerate, they are cast into the flames
- They know troll regeneration well and take no chances

### The Prisoners

Searching the cavern, they discover:
- More weapons and armaments
- Heirloom art pieces
- Potential magical orcish artifacts

**The Makeshift Dungeon:**
At the back of the cave, they find a makeshift dungeon with 3 prisoners:
- **2 slain humans**
- **1 barely surviving elf**

### Ferin's Tale

They release the elf, a ranger named **[FERIN](/docs/aeternum/npcs/ferin)**, who recounts:
- They were part of the **second mercenary party** sent from Meria
- Sent to slay the goblin leader
- Were ambushed and captured
- He is the sole survivor after a week of torture at the beasts' hands
- His companions were killed during captivity

### Intelligence Gathering

During their rest in the cave, **Nynora finally learns the Orc language** and begins to decipher the books and scrolls they have gathered:

**Poetry Scrolls:**
- Some appear to be rough poetry stanzas
- Potentially denoting spell scrolls (arcane knowledge hidden in verse)

**Direct Orders:**
- Others are direct orders to slay and loot trade caravans
- Sealed with the **red-handed signatures** of:
  - **UGLUK THE RED** - Main orc warlord
  - **GAUOREZZ NIGHTSTALKER** - His hobgoblin lieutenant

**The Three Ciphers:**
On one of the scrolls, **3 symbolic orc ciphers** appear:
1. **Three trees and boulder** - Potentially denoting this very cavern
2. **Skull with X symbols** - Unknown location
3. **Lone spire with two circles** - Unknown location

These ciphers suggest a network of Red Hand operations across the region.

### The Second Ambush

Fearing to camp anywhere near the cave, the party sallies forth and makes for **THE NORTH ROAD**.

As they cross the desolate GRAY HILLS at dawn, they are ambushed by **more dragonborn ninja of THE GOLDEN ORDER** who had apparently been tracking them.

**The Bounty Revealed:**
On their scrolls sealed with **the sign of Tiamat**, they learn that **Shorea has a 999 gold piece bounty on his head**.

**The Battle:**
- The ninja unleash alchemical grenades
- Attempt a smoke bomb retreat
- The fellowship slays all three attackers

### Safe Camp

Exhausted and bloodied from the night of danger, **FERIN finds a suitable campsite** and they finally take a much-needed **day of rest**.

The toll of the goblin caves and the Golden Order ambush weighs heavily on them. They sleep deeply, recovering strength.

### Uneventful Travel

The next day, they travel uneventfully down the road, camping again without incident.

The peace is a welcome change from the constant combat of the previous days.

### The Dwarven Caravan

The next day, they come across a guarded caravan from **THANE'S HOLD** headed to Meria. The caravan is captained by **[BRAX BJORNSON](/docs/aeternum/npcs/brax-bjornson)**, whom they decide to join after some hearty greetings and a game of dice.

**The Deal:**
After bartering their services as escorts in exchange for information, the party heads on a 2-day journey back to Meria.

**Dwarven Hospitality:**
Along the way, they enjoy:
- Dwarven fire whiskey
- Roasted mutton
- Stories of the road

### Learning the Situation at The Gray Gate

The fellowship learns more about the current beleaguered battlelines of **THE GRAY GATE**:
- The situation is dire
- The defenders are hard-pressed
- Reinforcements have not arrived
- The battle is not going well

### Zadshen's Revelations

The aasimar paladin reveals significant information:
- His potential claim to the **throne of DARGO**
- His past assignment in **THANE'S HOLD**
- Where he learned Dwarven with a paramour there

**Brax's Interest:**
Brax takes noticed interest in this revelation and:
- Offers Zadshen his personal seal of **THANE'S MERCHANT GUILD**
- Tells him to meet him in **1 week's time**
- At the **GILDED CREST tavern** outside the dwarven guild embassy in Meria

### The Question of Loyalty

Brax probes the adventurers with the crucial question that will define the coming months:

> "Where will your loyalties ultimately lie in the coming months?"

This question hangs over them as they approach Meria.

### The Rusty Axle

They arrive at the outskirts of MERIA and settle in for the night at the rough **RUSTY AXLE tavern and brothel**.

**Increased Security:**
They mark the **increased MERIA guard patrols** walking the city limits. The city is clearly on edge.

### Shorea's Intelligence

They retire to their rooms for the night, but not before the meditating dragonborn samurai **overhears an outrider** come in from **THE GRAY WASTES**.

**Dire News:**
The outrider shares with the barkeep:
- The situation at THE GRAY GATE is **dire**
- **GATE COMMANDER SAPENTUS** is making a **last stand**
- He and his men are **under siege by THE RED HORDE**

**The Mysterious Ranger:**
When asked, the gray and grizzled ranger:
- Would give no more information
- Mentioned he had encountered dragonborn before
- Disappeared into the night

### Entering Meria

The next day, the wagon party enters the main gate of MERIA where:
- **BRAX craftily bribes a gate guard**
- Shows his merchant guild writ to account for his increased escort
- Successfully talks their way through

**The Tense City:**
The city is abuzz and **much more tense** since they departed:
- Regiments of MERIA soldiers in full force in the streets
- Citizens on edge
- Military buildup visible everywhere
- War is clearly coming

### Return to The Laughing Dragon

BRAX and his men bid farewell as the party enters **THE LAUGHING DRAGON**.

**The Changed Atmosphere:**
They find the bar chock full of:
- Pirates
- Brigands
- Olive-skinned sailors
- Drinking to a raucous band of exotic drummers

**Gromwinston the Garrulous** lazily lounges on stage smoking his pipe as the dragonborn tips him again (generous as always).

### Meeting with Brornor

The party sits at the bar to get the attention of:
- **YARIN**, the silver dwarf innkeeper (second-in-command to Brornor)
- Who fetches his boss

**Brornor's Weary Welcome:**
**BRORNOR**, looking mighty weary, happily greets the fellowship and invites them back to his private office at the back of the tavern where he does business.

**Contract Completion:**
After inspecting:
- The goblin shaman circlet
- Counting the goblin and orc ears taken

He decides to **up their payment to sixty gold pieces each** for a contract well executed.

**Brornor's Past:**
When asked, he also reticently mentions he has a **troubled past with BRAX**.

This hint at dwarven politics and old grudges adds depth to the world.

### The Dire Political News

Concluding their business, Brornor eyes the party markedly and shares with them the dire political news from the week past:

**House Aetherius Abandons the Gate:**
The sad word on the mouths of the mounted couriers is that **HOUSE AETHERIUS has not sent any reinforcements** to the front at THE GRAY GATE.

**Meria's Response:**
**HOUSE MERIA has sent several regiments** to reinforce and hopefully break the lines of THE RED HORDE, with a **new battalion being mustered** in the city as they speak.

**The Looming Crisis:**
Brornor shares that although he likes the party, he has been **forbidden by OREON and the other guild lords** to offer any mercenary contracts other than those that directly reinforce the frontline at THE GATE.

**The Only Job Available:**
He laments that this is the only work he can offer sellswords such as they are, and **fears they may not return** if they embark with the MERIA forces.

### The Coming Total War

With some candor, Brornor sizes up the fellowship and asks where their loyalty will lie in the coming conflicts.

**His Assessment:**
He senses that the battle in the north is but the **opening move in a brewing total war** between:
- The great houses
- Lesser forces
- In AETERNUM in this new era of chaos

**The Choice:**
The party must now decide - do they join the Meria battalion heading to almost certain death at The Gray Gate, or do they seek another path?

**Chapter End:**
The weight of the coming war settles on their shoulders as they contemplate their next move.

## Chapter IV: "Road to the Wood"

**Date:** Last days of 1111.1AE
**Location:** Meria, then journey to The Fellwood
**Party Level:** 4

### The Decision

Our party decides to **stay the week in MERIA** at THE LAUGHING DRAGON after voting to **not join the departing battalion** of over 1,000 Meria soldiers headed to reinforce THE GRAY GATE.

This decision will save their lives, as the Gate ultimately falls.

### Visions and Dreams

Leading up to arriving in the city, the party members receive divine communications:

**Ulrick's Warning (Silvanus):**
In dreams and visions, Ulrick is warned by **Silvanus** that:
- If he seeks to satisfy his revenge for his family
- It could lead him down a **dark path**
- The nature god foresees the corruption that revenge might bring

**Zadshen's Vision (Leviathan):**
Zadshen receives a vision from **Leviathan** during his mysterious planar disappearance showing:
- Clues about the **first fallen angel**
- Leading into the FELLWOOD
- His quest continues into the great forest

**Shorea's Dream (Bahamut):**
Shorea dreams of **Bahamut** urging him to:
- Release the bound **demon of rage** he mysteriously harbors
- The dragon god knows the curse must be confronted

**Nynora's Omen:**
En route to the city the day before, Nynora sees a **hawk drop a scroll** in view of her:
- Just like the missives her father used to receive from **'W'**
- The mysterious messages continue

### The Week in Meria

The party decides to await **Zadshen's planned meeting with BRAX in one week**.

During this time, they engage in various activities:

**Trading and Upgrades:**
They are introduced to **BRORNOR's guild contacts** to make their required trading:
- **ORNN** - The Laughing Dragon resident blacksmith
- **"THE FENCE"** - A mysterious elf in the trade quarter of the city

**The Haul:**
They sold most of their loot for a sizable payday, trading some of it in for:
- New armor
- Masterwork weapons

**Items Kept:**
- The three **black iron rings of constitution**
- The **amulet of lesser protection**

### Individual Pursuits

**Ulrick's Ocean Prayer:**
Ulrick:
- Enjoys seeing the ocean for the first time (a profound moment for the Fellwood native)
- Prays for a vision from Silvanus
- Realizes he is being called back to his home in **THE FELLWOOD**
- Sends a carrier sparrow to **Thalindra** who bids him return to his home village of **OAKENLEAF**

**Arca's Quest:**
Arca busies himself seeking out other acolytes of Alaya within the city and:
- Gets a lead on one of the **oracles' ashes**
- And sacred burial artifacts being kept in **THE TOWER OF DUSK** by mages of HOUSE AETHERIUS
- This will become important in his personal quest

**Shorea's Intel:**
Shorea asks around the tavern for news of any dragonborn and hears that:
- His elder senpai **YURIO ZARASHI** has been sighted in **DARGO**
- Seeking to duel the knights there
- A connection to his past and his people

**Nynora's Research:**
Nynora disguises herself and enters the **MERIA great library** where she:
- Bonds with **ARCHIVIST BELVAS** who helps her research
- The two letters from **'W'** she has received

**The Draconic Cipher:**
The second letter, written in **Draconic**, was a coded cipher that warns:

> **"Nejune moves against Dargo on the Blood Moon"**

A **celestial ritual event** occurring in two months time (1111.4AE).

This intelligence proves crucial to later events.

**Zadshen's Diplomacy:**
Zadshen headed to the **MERIA guildhall HQ** on an isle in the port district and:
- Asked around the ambassadors there for any access to **OREON himself**
- And inquired about the current war

**What He Learned:**
- No one gets meetings with the guild lords until they are the **highest ranking mercenaries**
- Most soldiers believed the situation at THE GRAY GATE was **spiraling fast**
- The pessimism was palpable among the ranks

### Meeting with Brax

After meeting with **BRAX**, Zadshen received an offer:

**The Dwarven Contract:**
Asking him and his companions to:
- Come live in **THANE'S HOLD**
- As sworn guards of **THE MERCHANT GUILD**
- If the keep closes its gates in the coming war

**The Terms:**
- **Eleven thousand gold pieces per year**
- Potentially lasting up to a decade
- As the dwarves close their heavily fortified gates:
  - Upper gates to THE GRAY WASTES
  - Lower gates leading into THE UNDERDARK
- Hoping to wait out THE RED HORDE'S onslaught

This is an enormous sum and represents safety, but also isolation from the wider war.

### The Decision to Head South

The party decided many of their goals align with heading south in **THE FELLWOOD** to return to Ulrick's home village of **OAKENLEAF** where his mentor **THALINDRA** was asking for him.

**Aligned Goals:**
- **Zadshen** hoped to gain more clues about his quarry there (the fallen angels)
- **Ulrick** was called back by Silvanus and Thalindra
- **Arca** spoke happily of his connections with THE BLESSED OF ALAYA

**Arca's Past:**
Arca revealed he had been trained and blessed by **MISTRAYA herself** during his time with the order.

### On the Road South

**The Black Gulls:**
On the road, they handily slew a crew of **bandits** demanding a toll:
- Bearing the mark of **THE BLACK GULLS**
- Another faction in the complex web of power

**Into the Fellwood:**
They headed south into the forest and began following a rushing creek running parallel to the road.

**The Gnome Caravan:**
The party came upon a **forest gnome caravan** guarded by **elves of THE FELLWOOD WATCH**:
- They bought some trinkets from the merchants
- Asked about their goals and the situation in the forest
- Gathered intelligence on the region

### The Wolves

During the night's watch, they spot a pack of **dire wolves** seemingly following them.

This ominous presence suggests something is tracking the party through the forest.

### The Crystal Lake

Following the creek south, they arrive at a crystal clear lake where they make camp.

**The Mysterious Disappearance:**
During the night:
- **Nynora and Ulrick disappear**
- No sign of struggle
- They simply vanish into the forest

### The Hunt Begins

The next day, **Zadshen, Shorea, and Arca** decided to follow the monstrous tracks found near the lake.

**Their Intent:**
Hoping to hunt some of the **hobgoblin cutthroat bands** sent by THE RED HORDE to apparently:
- Parlay with the forest tribes of orcs
- Secure an alliance
- Expand the Horde's reach into the Fellwood

**The Centaur Tracks:**
They discover the tracks are those of a **centaur band**, though they eventually lead them to an active battlefield.

### The Battle in the Meadow

They witness a battle between:
- The **dire wolf pack** they'd seen following them
- A **scouting party of hobgoblins**

**Aid to the Wolves:**
The fellowship assists the wolves in slaying the scouts.

**Mysterious Understanding:**
The dire wolves:
- Do not attack them outright
- Seem to recognize them as allies or at least not threats
- This is unusual behavior

### The War Horn

They hear the sounding **war horn** of another scouting party approaching.

**Second Battle:**
They defeat this party as well, and in an act of mercy:
- Even **heal multiple of the wolves back from near death**
- Including the **alpha of the pack**

**The Silent Gaze:**
A silent gaze of understanding passes between the aggressive wolf pack and the hunters, who back away slowly from their kills.

**A Bond Formed:**
Something has shifted - the wolves now see them as allies in the fight against the invaders.

### Onward

The three heroes double back on the trail they found and continue on their journey south, now with:
- Strange allies in the wolf pack
- Knowledge that the Horde is recruiting in the forest
- Concern for their missing companions

**Chapter End:**
Where are Ulrick and Nynora? What happened at the crystal lake? The mystery deepens as the party presses forward into the Fellwood.

---

## Chapter V: "Memories of Oakenleaf"

**Date:** 1111.2AE (Month 2 of the year)
**Location:** The Fellwood, Oakenleaf Village
**Party Level:** 5

### The Reunion

After departing the battlefield in the forest meadow, backing away from the wolf pack, **Zad, Sho, and Arca** re-meet up with **Ulrick** further north.

### Ulrick's Tale

Ulrick explains what happened:
- He and **Nynora** had gone to help an **elven child** find their lost rabbit **Thumper**
- Ended up speaking with a **tree spirit**
- Solving a riddle
- Later finding a lost cache of gold and gems

**Nynora's Departure:**
Ulrick reveals that Nynora, **determined to go rogue**, has:
- Ventured **alone into the forest**
- Intent on **picking up the trail of her mentor**
- Made the decision to leave the fellowship
- Her fate now unknown

This departure reduces the party permanently. Nynora will not be seen again.

### Force March to Oakenleaf

**Ulrick's Urgency:**
Wanting to make all haste back to his home village of **Oakenleaf**, Ulrick led the group south-southwest along the road.

They force marched through the night, pushing their endurance to reach his home as quickly as possible.

### Vonda the Druid

As they travel through the night, they came upon the lone camp of **VONDA**, a tiefling druid.

**Her Mission:**
She had been sent by her mentor **FAYRUS THE GREEN** to:
- Study the **magical blight** affecting the forest
- Document its spread and nature
- Report back to the Fellwood leadership

**Intel Shared:**
Vonda mentions that:
- **AENARION** and **FAYRUS** are leading a vanguard of hunters
- In the north of the Fellwood
- To track down and slay all of the encroaching hobgoblin parties
- Bearing the red hand

**Trading:**
- They traded with Vonda
- She shared some local herbal lore
- Then departed to continue her survey and study

### The Dark Site

Later on the road, they find a disturbing sight:
- **Corpses hanging** from an old wooden watch platform
- They sense the **taint of dark magic** there
- The work of necromancy

**Assuming NEJUNE:**
Believing this to be the work of the dark mages of NEJUNE, they:
- Quickly burn the dark site
- Cleanse it with fire
- Do not linger in the cursed place

### The Shambling Mound

The adventurers continued south, moving off the main road onto a rougher path known to Ulrick that led to his home village.

**The Ambush:**
Along the path, they encounter a terrible **shambling mound**:
- Laying in wait for its prey
- Over a pit of dead foliage and bones
- A plant monster of immense size and strength

They slay the creature in fierce combat.

**The Pit:**
In the plant beast's pit, they discover several valuable **undigested suits of armor** from previous victims.

### The Abandoned Outpost

Some miles ahead, they discover an **abandoned outpost**:
- Ransacked and emptied
- Its inhabitants piled dead in a clearing
- Recent massacre, perhaps only days old

**Vampire Spawn Attack:**
As they approach, a wicked **vampire spawn** attacks:
- Raises the small horde of **zombies** from the dead
- Attempts to overwhelm the party with the undead

**Victory:**
Using divine magic and blinding steel, they:
- Crush the vampire spawn
- Destroy the undead
- Discover the truth of the attack

**The Burnt Letter:**
They find a burnt letter from **FELLWOOD WATCH** urging:
- All small outposts and villages in the forest
- To **abandon their undefended territories**
- And make for the fortress
- The situation is clearly desperate

### Camp and Rest

After making camp for their first night of full rest in 2 days, they finally get some peace.

But the visions continue.

### Divine Communications

**Ulrick's Shadowy Veil:**
The night before, when attempting to contact Silvanus in ritual:
- Ulrick senses a **shadowy veil** over his ability to pray successfully
- Something is interfering with his connection to his god
- This foreshadows his eventual pact with Oberon

**Shorea's Revelation:**
During his night watch:
- Shorea stumbles for a moment
- Feels the water in his gourd seemingly **boiling**
- **BAHAMUT speaks in his mind**
- Warning that the **demon of rage is not in him, but in his liquid sword**
- The curse is in the blade itself, not the wielder
- This is a critical revelation

**Zadshen's Ping:**
Zadshen spends a moment confused as he:
- Senses **LEVIATHAN'S presence**
- Gets a **ping of a location** in his mind
- Approximately **200 miles away to the east**
- One of the fallen angels is there

### The Eagle Riders

They awaken at dawn to the piercing cries of **WATCH eagle riders** soaring overhead:
- Flying due west
- In formation
- Moving with purpose and urgency

### Entering the Valley

Continuing down the trail, they enter a wooded valley where:
- **Elven riders from the Watch** are also making for OAKENLEAF
- The party meets and trades with them
- Agrees to accompany them to the village

### The Ill News

They hear the **ill news of the morning**:

> **THE GRAY GATE burns, and its defenders have fallen.**

**The Fall:**
- Eagle riders sent by **AENARION** himself
- Witnessed the fortress aflame from high altitude
- **SAPENTUS** and all the men from:
  - AETHERIUS
  - MERIA
  - The WATCH
- Are **presumed dead**

This is a catastrophic defeat and opens the path for the Red Horde to advance south.

### Arrival at Oakenleaf

They arrive at Ulrick's home village to a **somber site**:
- Many of the villagers packing their goods
- Into barrels, bags, and carts
- Preparing for exodus

**The Riders' Mission:**
The elven riders mention they have been sent here to:
- Help the village prepare for an **exodus to the east**
- Seeing as more and more **undead have been sighted** in the southern woods
- The forest is no longer safe

### Thalindra's Illness

**Ulrick rushes** to the tent of the elders where:
- **BERUUS**, the wizened half-orc chief
- And the other sages
- Are gathered around a **bedridden THALINDRA**

**The Magical Disease:**
Ulrick learns that she and some of the others in the village have taken on a **dark illness** that:
- Chills the bones
- Saps vitality
- Not responding to any magical or herbal healing
- This is the **Blightrot**

### Thalindra's Report

She shares with the party all that has passed since her young pupil left the village:

**The Brewing War:**
A war is now brewing between:
- **HOUSE NEJUNE**
- And the allied forces of **THE FELLWOOD**

**The Hobgoblin Threat:**
With the hobgoblin commandos of THE RED HORDE:
- Recruiting from the north
- Adding forest orc tribes to their forces

**The Undead Threat:**
And now more sightings of the undead in the south:
- She believes **NEJUNE is now making their move**
- To blight the forest
- And attack the free peoples there

### Nejune's Goals

**Assumptions about Nejune:**
It is assumed that HOUSE NEJUNE ultimately wishes to:
- End the line of **HOUSE DARGO**
- Install their own puppet nobility there

**Others believe:**
That the dark magicians of NEJUNE seek to:
- Complete their age-old destruction of the **Moon Elves of ALAYA'S REST**
- Contest and even control all the **southern magic sites** within the FELLWOOD

### The Blood Moon

When asked about the **Blood Moon on 1111.4AE** (in 2 months), Thalindra reveals her fears:

**The Three Great Powers:**
The three great magical powers of AETERNUM will harness the **wild winds of magic** that night in their grand rituals to their own ends:

1. **NEJUNE** - For destruction
2. **AETHERIUS** - For knowledge
3. **BLESSED OF ALAYA** - For ascension

This celestial event will be a turning point in the war.

### The Council of the Wood

Thalindra spoke of a great **Council** to be held at **FELLWOOD WATCH in one week's time**, where:
- **AENARION** has called all leaders of the woodland realms
- Including **MISTRAYA**
- To meet and decide how they should approach the coming war

**Mistraya's Attendance:**
It is rumored that:
- MISTRAYA herself will meet the council
- Though she will not abandon the blessed **Springs of Alaya**
- That make up the core of ALAYA'S REST

### Mistraya the Immortal

It is rumored that MISTRAYA [along with FAYRUS THE GREEN] is:
- **The oldest elf alive on AETERNUM**
- And is **potentially immortal**

**Her Ambitions:**
Some say she:
- Parlays with the planes
- Even seeks to attain **demi-godhood**
- By becoming the **Avatar of Alaya**

### The Exodus Decision

**AENARION'S Strategy:**
AENARION has sent out riders to:
- Convince and gather all small villages and outposts
- To make for the safety of the walls at **the WATCH**
- Consolidating forces for defense

**Ulrick's Diplomacy:**
Ulrick, asked by his mentor herself:
- **Adeptly convinces the stubborn Beruus and the other elders**
- To gather the village to depart with the riders sent for the WATCH
- This saves many lives

### Thalindra's Farewell

**The Prophecy of Death:**
Thalindra warns Ulrick that:
- She will **die soon**
- And has **accepted this fate**
- Passing all her magic, items, and destiny onto the **hero of Oakenleaf**

This is her final gift to her student.

### Night Council

The party has much to ponder as they:
- Hear all this dire news
- Retire to the local inn
- Are given **four horses** as a gift from the village

### The All-Night Vigil

**Ulrick is invited** to stay up in an **all-night vigil and ritual** to Silvanus with Thalindra which:
- **Magically enhances his prized amulet**
- And **charges it with even more lightning power**
- This is their final communion
- A passing of power from master to student

### Interrogating the Town Drunk

**Shorea and Zadshen** attempt to interrogate the **town drunk** who:
- Claims to have been the first to be **blighted**
- Mumbles something about the **power of the NEJUNE artifacts**
- May know more than he lets on, but is too inebriated to be coherent

### Arca's Vision

**Arca sits in silent prayer** that night and:
- Breaks through to a vision of the radiant goddess **ALAYA**
- Who warns him that **all elves must leave AETERNUM before its potential destruction**
- This is a dire prophecy - the continent itself may be doomed

### Morning Departure

The next morning, they quickly:
- Sell off their excess weapons and armor to the local merchants
- **Ride together** planning to quickly make for **ALAYA'S REST**
- And accompany the caravan with **MISTRAYA** all the way to **FELLWOOD WATCH**

**Zadshen's Quest:**
Zadshen also inquires about bonding a wild beast to him with the local beastmaster **WOTANN**.

### The Werebear Ambush

Entering a clearing later that day, they found **signs of battle**:
- Multiple elves dead among the tall grass
- Signs of a fierce fight

**The Watchers:**
Crouched and in tattered clothes:
- **2 feral-looking humans** watch them across the meadow
- Eyes gleaming with unnatural light

**The Transformation:**
As the mounted party approaches:
- They **roar with terrible power**
- And **transform**
- Revealing themselves as **cursed werebears**

### The Cursed Battle

The party unleashes all their magical and martial might to slay the beasts.

**Zadshen's Close Call:**
Not before Zadshen:
- Narrowly avoids being **cursed himself**
- From a terrible bite
- Would have been infected with lycanthropy

**Preparation:**
The party:
- Double checks their saddles
- Steels their wills
- Preparing for the **perilous journey ahead**

**Chapter End:**
They ride west toward Alaya's Rest, knowing that greater dangers await in the shadowed paths of the Fellwood.
