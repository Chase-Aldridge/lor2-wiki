# World of LOR - Complete D&D Campaign Wiki

Welcome to the comprehensive reference wiki for the World of LOR D&D 5E campaign setting created and DM'd by Kevin Orosz.

## The World

**LOR** is the planet and world where these epic adventures take place. A vast super-continental and oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known - the planet is approximately 130% larger than Earth.

Tales and myths have been told about the formation of the world by the gods since the birth of the younger races. Various dogmas and schools of thought exist as far as timelines and metaphysical truths are concerned, however the reality is no one really knows. This diverse world is full of nations and empires of many stripes and inclinations.

## The Three Great Campaigns

### [Aeternum - The Fellowship of the Blade](/docs/aeternum)

**"The Aeternum Crisis"** - The first campaign set on the continent of AETERNUM in 1111AE.

The Fellowship of the Blade, known as **The Rúsitauri** ("The Sons of the Forest"), are fatetouched heroes who saved the continent from an apocalyptic threat when Kronus, the Titan of Time, was summoned to the Material Plane.

For over 300 years, AETERNUM was sealed by magical mists that prevented contact with the outside world. The continent was ruled by the intrigues, wars, treaties, and pacts between 4 major houses until the crisis that changed everything.

**Key Themes:** Prophecy, sealed continent, house politics, end times, saving the world

### [Gul'Rath - The Continent of Intrigue](/docs/gulrath)

The continent of **GUL'RATH** lies to the far north of LOR. Recorded history here begins over 10,000 years ago as detailed by the findings hidden in ancient ruins dotting the land.

The diverse continent is characterized by massive fields of highgrass, humid jungles, desolate volcanic mountains, crystalline deserts, and vast stretches of island archipelagos.

The varied kingdoms share a hard-won peace after a decade-long war known as **THE RED CRUSADE**, where a splinter faction of high elves waged total war against the combined alliance of yuan-ti, dwarves, and aarakocra. A new era of peace and political intrigue has begun.

**Key Themes:** Post-war politics, ancient civilizations, racial diversity, power consolidation

### [Plagas - The Savage Frontier](/docs/plagas)

**"The Plagas Prophecy"** - The sequel campaign set on the massive rainforest and desert archipelago continent to the far west in 1116AE.

**PLAGAS** is a land of wild mystery, lawlessness, titanic monster hunts, colonization, loxodon plant shamanism, and ruthless leonin tribal politics. This dangerous frontier continent is being colonized by powers from Gul'Rath, Cthon, Fortea, and independent factions.

The thick jungles, unforgiving beasts, and secretive indigenous tribes make this the ultimate proving ground for adventurers seeking fortune and glory.

**Key Themes:** Frontier colonization, monster hunting, tribal politics, wild nature, moral ambiguity
