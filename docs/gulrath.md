THE GUL’RATH CAMPAIGN
DND 5E CAMPAIGN SETTING BY KEVIN OROSZ

THE PLANET: LOR
LOR is the planet and world the heroes find themselves in. Tales and myths have been told about the formation of the world by the gods since the birth of the elder races. Various dogmas and schools of thought exist from the younger races as far as timelines and metaphysical truths are concerned, however the reality is no one really knows. This diverse world is full of nations and empires of many stripes and inclinations. Even those from beyond the Material Plane inhabit LOR, a vast super-continental and oceanic mass containing all major biomes and climates known (the planet is about 130% larger than the Earth we know). The continent of GUL’RATH where we begin lies to the far north of the planet, and is somewhat isolated due to the vast oceanic distances required to travel south by sea, and the massive tracks of the unexplored AER DESERT covering the bottom of the continent.



THE CONTINENT: GUL’RATH
Our adventurers find themselves embroiled in the epic saga of one major continent where they were born in the world of LOR, GUL’RATH. Recorded history here begins over 10,000 years ago as detailed by the findings hidden in the ancient ruins dotting the land. Whatever civilization first emerged here is unclear, but evidence suggests they were some type of exiled kingdom from beyond the Material Plane. The diverse continent is characterized by massive fields of highgrass, humid jungles, desolate volcanic mountains, crystalline deserts, and vast stretches of island archipelagos. The varied kingdoms of GUL’RATH share a hard-won peace present day after a decade-long war known as THE RED CRUSADE, where a splinter faction of the high elven kingdom of VOL’ANLEK waged total war against the combined alliance of the TAMARYEN yuan-ti, the IRONHELM dwarves, & the DRAGMAR AER aarakocra. The devastating conflict ended with a pyrrhic victory where the wild elves were banished to THE BLOOD LANDS and the major kingdoms vassalized most of the lesser factions in the peace accords. A new era of peace and political intrigue has begun with each nation seeking to consolidate their power base through trade, ritual, exploration, and plots…
