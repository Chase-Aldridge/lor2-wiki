# Gul'Rath

## The Continent

Our adventurers find themselves embroiled in the epic saga of one major continent where they were born in the world of LOR, **GUL'RATH**. Recorded history here begins over 10,000 years ago as detailed by the findings hidden in the ancient ruins dotting the land. Whatever civilization first emerged here is unclear, but evidence suggests they were some type of exiled kingdom from beyond the Material Plane.

The diverse continent is characterized by massive fields of highgrass, humid jungles, desolate volcanic mountains, crystalline deserts, and vast stretches of island archipelagos. The varied kingdoms of GUL'RATH share a hard-won peace present day after a decade-long war known as **THE RED CRUSADE**, where a splinter faction of the high elven kingdom of VOL'ANLEK waged total war against the combined alliance of the TAMARYEN yuan-ti, the IRONHELM dwarves, & the DRAGMAR AER aarakocra.

The devastating conflict ended with a pyrrhic victory where the wild elves were banished to THE BLOOD LANDS and the major kingdoms vassalized most of the lesser factions in the peace accords. A new era of peace and political intrigue has begun with each nation seeking to consolidate their power base through trade, ritual, exploration, and plots…

## The Red Crusade

The defining conflict of recent history. A decade-long war where a splinter faction of wild elves from VOL'ANLEK, led by the legendary Archknight Maldrake, waged total war against the combined forces of Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer. The war ended at the **Battle of Broken Blades** where Commander Striker Horun defeated Maldrake. The wild elves were banished to the Blood Lands, and the peace accords vassalized most lesser kingdoms under the great powers.
