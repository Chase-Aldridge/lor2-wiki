## Description

Cormandir stands as one of the most mysterious and feared kingdoms on the continent of Gul'Rath. Despite its relatively small population of only 50,000, this kingdom wields B Tier power through mastery of arcane magic that rivals or exceeds any other nation. Cormandir is home to **The Magisterium**, the only non-vassalized power remaining after The Red Crusade, a testament to both its magical might and political cunning.

The kingdom operates as an aristocratic magocracy where power is determined by magical bloodlines and arcane mastery. Every aspect of society revolves around the pursuit and application of magical knowledge, making Cormandir simultaneously one of the most advanced and most dangerous kingdoms in existence.

---

## Government Structure

### Aristocratic Magocracy

Cormandir's government is controlled entirely by The Magisterium, a cabal of the masters of colleges of magic. All positions of power are based on bloodlines, with magical ability inherited through carefully maintained aristocratic families. This creates a rigid hierarchy where:

- **Bloodline purity** determines initial standing
- **Magical power** determines advancement
- **Knowledge accumulation** provides influence
- **Ritual mastery** grants authority

The system maintains absolute secrecy and compartmentalization of their assets and agents, making it nearly impossible for outsiders to understand the true power structures within Cormandir.

### Grand Magister Tenebros

The current leader of both Cormandir and The Magisterium is **Grand Magister Tenebros**, a tiefling Arch Magister whose power level is rated S+ Tier (Godlike, levels 21+). This makes him one of the most powerful individuals on the entire continent, comparable only to the slain Archknight Maldrake in terms of raw power.

Tenebros rules with lawful evil precision, pursuing magical knowledge and power without moral constraints. His reputation for diabolical experiments and otherworldly contacts makes him feared even by other kingdom leaders.

## The Magisterium

### Organization

- **Population**: 10,000
- **Races**: Tiefling, Sea Elf, High Elf
- **Leader**: Grand Magister Tenebros
- **Power Ranking**: A Tier
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Deity**: Kronus

The Magisterium is the true power behind Cormandir, functioning as both government and magical research institution. Little is known about this power cabal centered in the mage high tower of Cormandir, as they maintain strict secrecy about their operations, membership, and capabilities.

### Structure

The Magisterium is organized into colleges of magic, each specializing in different schools and applications of arcane power:

**Colleges of Magic**
- Evocation - Destructive spells and battlefield magic
- Necromancy - Death magic and undead control
- Conjuration - Summoning and planar contact
- Divination - Information gathering and prophecy
- Enchantment - Mind control and manipulation
- Transmutation - Reality alteration and transformation
- Abjuration - Protection and defensive magic
- Illusion - Deception and psychological warfare

Each college is led by a Magister who reports directly to the Grand Magister. The absolute secrecy and compartmentalization means that even members of The Magisterium may not know what other colleges are researching or planning.

## Magical Capabilities

### Arcane Mastery

Cormandir's mages are among the most powerful spellcasters on the continent. Their bloodline-based system ensures that magical talent is concentrated and refined through generations. The kingdom's relatively small population belies its magical might—a single Cormandir archmage may be worth hundreds of conventional soldiers in terms of destructive capability.

### Forbidden Research

The Magisterium is rumored to conduct research that other kingdoms would consider:
- Diabolical experiments crossing ethical boundaries
- Planar contact with dangerous entities
- Necromantic rituals on massive scales
- Reality-warping transmutation
- Mind control programs affecting entire populations

This willingness to pursue any magical knowledge, regardless of moral implications, gives Cormandir access to powers unavailable to more ethically constrained kingdoms.

### Psionic Potential

Recently, The Magisterium is rumored to have discovered psionic potential, representing a new frontier in mental and psychic powers. This discovery could grant them capabilities entirely outside traditional magical frameworks, making their power even more difficult to counter.

---

## Planar Connections

### The Nine Hells

The Magisterium has known connections to The Nine Hells, the plane of lawful evil devils. This relationship provides:
- Access to infernal magic and rituals
- Potential pacts with devil lords
- Diabolic knowledge unavailable through conventional study
- Possible soul trade arrangements

The tiefling population of Cormandir likely relates to these infernal connections, with many tieflings descended from ancient pacts with devils.

### The Outer Realm

Grand Magister Tenebros has been rumored to have conducted diabolical experiments to contact The Outer Realm, a mysterious plane about which little is known. This suggests that Cormandir's planar research extends beyond the well-mapped planes into truly unknown territories.

### Practical Applications

These planar connections provide Cormandir with:
- Otherworldly allies and servants
- Magic systems unknown to other kingdoms
- Strategic intelligence from beings with cosmic perspectives
- Potential escape routes if conventional warfare turns against them

---

## Religion

### Kronus Worship

Cormandir worships **Kronus**, the male titan of time who appears as a black arcane hulk. Kronus is one of the first three titans created and gave birth to all the other gods of LOR, making him one of the most ancient and powerful entities in existence.

**Kronus's Domains**: Death, Knowledge, Arcana
**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
**Sacred Weapon**: Magic itself
**Colors**: Pure Black
**Offerings**: Time, lifespan, blood
**Divine Plane**: Unknown

The worship of Kronus reflects Cormandir's willingness to sacrifice anything—including mortal lives, time, and even their own lifespans—in pursuit of magical knowledge and power. The fact that Kronus's plane is unknown adds to the mystery surrounding both the deity and his worshipers.

### Philosophical Implications

Worshiping the titan who created the gods places The Magisterium in a unique theological position. They see themselves as pursuing understanding of the fundamental forces that shaped reality itself, making them more researchers of divinity than traditional worshipers.

---

## Economic and Diplomatic Isolation

### Limited Trade

Trade and diplomacy is severely limited with other factions. The Magisterium maintains this isolation deliberately, preferring self-sufficiency to entanglement with other kingdoms. What trade does occur involves:

**Magical Services**
- Powerful spells and rituals available for hire
- Magical item creation (at extreme cost)
- Divination services
- Curse removal or curse placement

**The Price of Magic**

The Magisterium's magic spells and rituals come at excruciating prices when offered. These prices may include:
- Enormous gold payments
- Rare magical components
- Personal service or indentured servitude
- Information or secrets
- Portions of one's lifespan
- Unspecified future favors

This pricing structure ensures that only the most desperate or wealthy ever deal with Cormandir, further maintaining their isolation.

---

## Military Capabilities

Despite their small population, Cormandir's B Tier ranking reflects their formidable military capabilities:

### Magical Warfare

Cormandir's entire military doctrine revolves around magic:
- Battle mages capable of devastating area attacks
- Summoned creatures and devils as shock troops
- Necromantic armies that never tire or fear death
- Defensive wards protecting key locations
- Teleportation allowing rapid response to threats

### Quality Over Quantity

With only 50,000 total population and 10,000 in The Magisterium itself, Cormandir cannot field large conventional armies. Instead, they rely on each mage being capable of affecting battlefield outcomes normally requiring thousands of soldiers.

### Deterrence Strategy

Cormandir's true defense lies in uncertainty. Other kingdoms don't know the full extent of The Magisterium's capabilities, and the reputation for forbidden magic and planar allies creates fear that deters aggression. The fact that they remained independent after The Red Crusade while other kingdoms were vassalized demonstrates the effectiveness of this deterrence.

---

## Independence After The Red Crusade

### The Only Exception

Cormandir is explicitly noted as "the only non-vassalized power remaining after THE RED CRUSADE." While other lesser kingdoms were forced into vassalage by the victorious alliance of Vol'Anlek, Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer, Cormandir retained its independence.

### How They Maintained Freedom

Several factors likely contributed to this:

1. **Magical Deterrence** - The cost of conquering Cormandir would exceed any benefit
2. **Unknown Capabilities** - No kingdom wants to discover what forbidden magic The Magisterium might unleash
3. **Planar Allies** - Connections to The Nine Hells and Outer Realm provide powerful backup
4. **Strategic Unimportance** - Small population and limited territory make them less attractive targets
5. **Useful Services** - All kingdoms occasionally need magical services that only Cormandir provides
6. **Tenebros's Personal Power** - An S+ Tier Godlike being leading the kingdom makes conquest potentially catastrophic

## Notable Locations

### The Mage High Tower

The center of power in Cormandir and headquarters of The Magisterium. This legendary structure is said to:
- Reach impossible heights through spatial distortion
- Exist partially in multiple planes simultaneously
- Contain libraries of forbidden knowledge
- House Grand Magister Tenebros's personal sanctum
- Serve as the meeting place for the council of Magisters

### Research Facilities

Scattered throughout Cormandir are secret research facilities where The Magisterium conducts their most dangerous experiments. The locations of most facilities are known only to those who work within them, maintaining the compartmentalization that protects The Magisterium's secrets.

---

## Notable NPCs

### S+ Tier Hero

**Grand Magister Tenebros**
- **Race and Class**: Tiefling Arch Magister
- **Known Equipment**: Cloak of Shadows
- **Headquarters**: Cormandir
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Tier**: S+

One of only two S+ Tier individuals known on the continent (the other being the slain Archknight Maldrake). As a Godlike being of level 21+, Tenebros possesses power that transcends normal magical limitations. His reputation for diabolical experiments includes:

- Contact with The Nine Hells
- Experiments reaching The Outer Realm
- Discovery of psionic potential
- Mastery of all schools of magic
- Control over time-based magic through Kronus worship

The Cloak of Shadows he wears is said to grant protection from divination and allow travel through the Shadowfell, making him nearly impossible to track or ambush.

---

## Relationships with Other Kingdoms

### Isolated

Cormandir maintains minimal formal relationships with other kingdoms. Their lawful evil alignment and reputation for diabolical experiments makes them universally distrusted, even by other evil-aligned powers.

### Necessary Evil

Despite the distrust, all kingdoms occasionally require magical services that only The Magisterium can provide:
- Removing powerful curses
- Contacting the dead for crucial information
- Creating magical items of exceptional power
- Divination about existential threats
- Breaking magical bindings or barriers

This makes Cormandir simultaneously isolated and indispensable.

### No Known Vassals

Unlike other powers, Cormandir has not vassalized any lesser kingdoms. This reflects both their isolation and their focus on magical research over territorial expansion.

---

## Current Status and Future Threats

### Present Situation

Cormandir exists in a state of careful isolation, pursuing magical knowledge while maintaining sufficient deterrent power to ensure independence. The kingdom's lawful evil nature means they follow systematic plans rather than chaotic evil destruction, making them predictable but not less dangerous.

### Potential Threats

Cormandir's activities pose several threats to the continent:

1. **Catastrophic Magical Accidents** - Forbidden research could unleash forces beyond control
2. **Planar Invasion** - Connections to The Nine Hells or Outer Realm might invite invasion
3. **Psionic Domination** - Newly discovered psionic powers could enable mass mind control
4. **Kronus Worship Consequences** - Sacrificing time and lifespan to a titan of chaotic evil may have terrible prices
5. **Arcane Arms Race** - Other kingdoms attempting to match Cormandir's magic might trigger escalation

### Strategic Importance

Despite its small size and isolation, Cormandir represents a critical piece of continental politics. The Magisterium's independence after The Red Crusade proves that magical power can rival conventional military might. Other kingdoms must consider Cormandir in their calculations, knowing that the kingdom of mages could tip the balance in any future conflict—or unleash devastation that recognizes no borders.

Grand Magister Tenebros's S+ Tier power level means he could potentially defeat any other kingdom's leader in single combat, making Cormandir's neutrality a blessing for all sides. The true question is not whether Cormandir is powerful enough to matter, but whether their pursuit of forbidden knowledge will eventually threaten the entire continent.
