## Description

Tamaryen is the largest city on the continent of Gul'Rath and stands as one of the most formidable military powers in the known world. With a massive population of 600,000 Yuan-Ti, it represents the single largest concentration of military and naval power on the continent.

The Yuan-Ti of Tamaryen are notorious for their military juntas and rigorous laws that govern every aspect of society. Their civilization operates under a strict caste system where Red Yuan-Ti are considered nobility and hold positions of religious and political authority, while Black Yuan-Ti form the elite warrior class that enforces the will of the state.

---

## Government Structure

Tamaryen operates as a military autocracy under the absolute rule of **Praetor Sasaren**, a black Yuan-Ti known for his exceptional cruelty towards prisoners of war. Despite his warrior caste origins, Sasaren has seized total control of the kingdom's government, police, and trade networks through military might and cunning.

### The Caste System

**Red Yuan-Ti** (Nobility)
- Population: 400,000
- Religious and philosophical leaders
- Ancient bloodlines dating back generations
- Control religious institutions and diplomatic affairs
- Aligned with The Trinitum faction

**Black Yuan-Ti** (Warriors)
- Population: 290,000 (includes military forces)
- Elite warrior class
- Direct enforcers of the Praetor's will
- Control military, police, and trade

## Military Power

Tamaryen boasts the largest numerical standing military and naval fleets on the continent and controls the northern seas. This massive military advantage, combined with their strategic naval dominance, makes them an A Tier power despite internal political tensions between the red and black castes.

### The Black Order
- **Population**: 290,000
- **Leader**: Praetor Sasaren
- **Power Ranking**: A Tier
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil

A newly risen faction of warrior class black Yuan-Ti who serve Sasaren without question. They are cruel masters of war and espionage, notorious for their rogues, necromancers, rangers, and fighters. The Black Order has achieved total control over the current kingdom government, police, and trade operations.

### Military Capabilities
- Largest standing army on the continent
- Most extensive naval fleet, controlling northern sea routes
- Elite special forces trained in espionage and assassination
- Necromantic battalions
- Naval superiority in all contested waters

## Economy and Trade

Tamaryen's lands and holdings are just as liable to trade slaves (with humans being the most prized) as they are to trade in valuable intelligence on the other kingdoms. This dual economy of flesh and secrets makes them both feared and necessary trading partners.

The kingdom maintains extensive trade networks throughout Gul'Rath, though their practice of slavery creates tension with more morally aligned kingdoms. Their intelligence gathering operations are unmatched, making them a valuable source of information for kingdoms willing to deal with them.

---

## Religion and Philosophy

### The Worship of Tiamat

Tamaryen's official deity is **Tiamat**, the female goddess of chaos who appears as a terrible five-headed dragon. This worship reflects the kingdom's embrace of chaotic principles within a rigidly structured society.

**Tiamat's Domains**: Death, Nature, Tempest
**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil
**Sacred Weapon**: Wakizashi
**Colors**: White, Black, Green, Blue, and Red (representing her five heads)
**Offerings**: Parchment, ash, or music
**Divine Plane**: Draconium (The Abyss)

### The Trinitum
- **Population**: 400,000
- **Leader**: Lord Zaz Crimsonscale
- **Power Ranking**: B Tier
- **Alignment**: True Neutral

The oldest order among the Yuan-Ti, ruled over by lines of red nobility for generations. The Trinitum is religious and curious to obtain power in the shadows, utilizing warlocks, bards, barbarians, clerics, and wizards in their operations.

Currently, The Trinitum is vying for power to spread their teachings and influence abroad under the leadership of **Lord Zaz Crimsonscale**. They also worship **Draconiss**, the male god of all dragonkin, in addition to Tiamat, representing the dual nature of Yuan-Ti religious practices.

## Political Dynamics

Tamaryen exists in a state of internal tension between two powerful factions:

**The Black Order** (Current Power)
- Controls government, military, and trade

- Lawful Evil alignment
- Focus on military domination and expansion

**The Trinitum** (Challenging Power)
- Ancient noble bloodlines
- Led by Lord Zaz Crimsonscale
- True Neutral alignment
- Focus on philosophical teaching and shadow influence

This internal power struggle adds complexity to Tamaryen's external relations, as different factions may pursue conflicting diplomatic goals.

---

## The Red Crusade

During The Red Crusade, Tamaryen formed the backbone of the military alliance against the wild elf bloodletters. Their massive standing army and naval fleets were crucial to the eventual victory, and the conflict allowed them to vassalize Jalurian in the peace accords, expanding their sphere of influence.

---

## Current Status

Tamaryen stands as an A Tier power and the most militarily dominant kingdom on the continent. Their control of the northern seas and possession of the largest standing army makes them a force that cannot be ignored in continental politics.

However, internal tensions between The Black Order and The Trinitum create potential instability. The kingdom continues its controversial practices of slavery and intelligence trading, which simultaneously makes them economically powerful and diplomatically isolated from more morally aligned kingdoms.

The current era of peace has allowed Tamaryen to consolidate power through trade, espionage, and political maneuvering rather than open warfare, though their military readiness remains unmatched.
