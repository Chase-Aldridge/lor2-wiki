## The Red Crusade and Power Structure

The current political structure of Gul'Rath was largely determined by the outcome of **The Red Crusade**—a decade-long war where a splinter faction of wild elves from Vol'Anlek, led by the legendary Archknight Maldrake, waged total war against the combined alliance of Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer.

### The War
- Vol'Anlek split between loyalists and wild elf rebels
- Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer formed defensive alliance
- Decade of devastating warfare across the continent
- Ended at the Battle of Broken Blades

### The Outcome
- Wild elves defeated by Commander Striker Horun
- Archknight Maldrake slain
- Wild elves banished to the Blood Lands
- Peace accords vassalized most lesser factions:
  - **Ithiltara** → Vassal under Dragmar Aer
  - **Jalurian** → Protectorate under Tamaryen
  - **Saint Helensberg** → Vassal under Vol'Anlek
  - **Cormandir** → Remained independent (only exception)

### Current Era
A new era of peace and political intrigue has begun, with each nation seeking to consolidate power through trade, ritual, exploration, and plots rather than open warfare. However, nomadic bands of wild elf bloodletters continue to threaten travelers and conduct raids from the Blood Lands.

## Political Dynamics

### The Great Powers Alliance
Vol'Anlek, Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer maintain their wartime alliance in theory, though each pursues their own interests:
- **Ironhelm** - Most powerful militarily, focused on internal development
- **Tamaryen** - Largest military, expanding influence through vassalage
- **Vol'Anlek** - Religious and magical power, controlling northwest realms
- **Dragmar Aer** - Economic dominance, intelligence network

### Vassalization Structure
- Dragmar Aer controls Ithiltara (economic dependency)
- Tamaryen controls Jalurian (military protection)
- Vol'Anlek controls Saint Helensberg (extractive tariffs)

### The Cormandir Exception
Only Cormandir remained independent after The Red Crusade, suggesting their magical power and connections to otherworldly entities made them too dangerous or costly to conquer.
