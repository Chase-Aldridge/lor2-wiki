## Description

Vol'Anlek is a great city built upon ancient "Forebearer" jungle ruins, representing one of the most historically significant locations on the continent of Gul'Rath. The high elves of Vol'Anlek are the oldest race to inhabit the continent and control much of the northwest realms, maintaining their dominance through centuries of careful stewardship and iron-clad traditions.

The high elves are masters of war, statecraft, and magic, yet they are slow to change traditions and mistrust outsiders. Their society is deeply rooted in ancient customs and religious observance, with their theocratic government intertwining spiritual authority with political power.

## Government Structure

Vol'Anlek is ruled by a theocratic monarchy where religious and political authority are inseparable. Two major noble families share power within this structure:

### Great House Alephor
The oldest and most religious house of the high elves, ruled by hereditary bloodlines. The current leader, **Ludus Alephor**, holds the title of Grand Hierophant and serves as the de facto religious ruler of the entire kingdom. Ludus is known as a ruthless and dogmatic archmage who maintains strict adherence to tradition and religious law.

House Alephor commands masters of magical combat, utilizing wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and druids in their military forces.

### House Horun
The lesser noble house, led by **Commander Striker Horun**, who earned his title as "elvenkind's strongest soldier" and general of the Golden Legions. Striker Horun is famous for defeating the betrayer Archknight Maldrake and his wild elf bloodletters at the Battle of Broken Blades, ending The Red Crusade.

House Horun commands the Golden Legion, highly trained in regimented war stratagems using fighters, paladins, clerics, rangers, and monks.

## The Red Crusade

Vol'Anlek was at the center of The Red Crusade, a devastating decade-long war that defined recent continental history. A splinter faction of wild elves from Vol'Anlek, led by the charismatic and terrifying **Archknight Maldrake**, broke away from the kingdom and waged total war against the combined alliance of Tamaryen, Ironhelm, and Dragmar Aer.

The conflict ended with a pyrrhic victory at the **Battle of Broken Blades**, where Commander Striker Horun defeated Maldrake. The wild elves were banished to The Blood Lands, though nomadic bands of wild elf bloodletters continue to pose threats, particularly to travelers through the Aer Desert and raids on Dragmar Aer territories.

## Current Status

Vol'Anlek currently enjoys a hard-won peace following The Red Crusade, though the kingdom remains vigilant. The political balance between House Alephor and House Horun continues, with both families wielding significant military and magical power. The kingdom maintains control over the northwest realms and continues its vassalage over Saint Helensberg.

The high elves remain slow to change their traditions and continue to mistrust outsiders, making diplomatic relations challenging with other kingdoms. However, their mastery of war, statecraft, and magic ensures they remain one of the Great Kingdoms of Gul'Rath despite their B Tier power ranking.
