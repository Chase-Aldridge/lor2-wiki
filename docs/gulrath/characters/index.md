---

## Rivalries and Alliances

### Internal Rivalries

**Vol'Anlek**
- Striker Horun (military power) vs. Ludus Alephor (magical/religious power)
- Both S Tier heroes in same kingdom creates tension

**Tamaryen**
- Praetor Sasaren (current power) vs. Lord Zaz Crimsonscale (challenging power)
- Warrior caste vs. noble caste conflict

### Cross-Kingdom Relationships

**Allied**
- Striker Horun and Aldrick Ironshield (war allies)
- Huren Dragonhelm and Aldrick Ironshield (political allies)

**Competitive**
- Ludus Alephor and Tenebros (magical rivalry)
- Laedaere and Rerumaj Cloudfeather (overlord-vassal tension)

**Opposed**

- Tenebros vs. Everyone (lawful evil isolationist)

---

## The Power Gap

The tier system reveals massive power gaps:

**S+ to S Tier** - Maldrake required combined kingdoms to defeat, Tenebros untouchable
**S to A Tier** - S Tier heroes could likely defeat multiple A Tier opponents
**A to B Tier** - Single realm influence vs. regional influence
**B to C Tier** - Continental impact vs. local impact

This creates a world where individual heroes can be worth entire armies, explaining why personality and alignment of rulers matters as much as kingdom resources.

## Succession Questions

### Vulnerable Kingdoms

**Leadership Gaps**
- What happens if Aldrick Ironshield falls? (Ironhelm's stability)
- If Striker Horun dies, does House Horun lose military dominance?
- Tenebros has no named successor (Cormandir vulnerable)

**Power Struggles**
- Tamaryen's Sasaren vs. Crimsonscale conflict unresolved
- Vol'Anlek's dual S Tier heroes could fight for supremacy

### Rising Powers

**Potential S Tier**
- Could Sasaren or Crimsonscale reach S Tier?
- Is Laedaere growing stronger through exploration?
- What is Chief Darius's true power?
