## Bankai System

Bankai is a unique power system available to heroes in the World of LOR campaigns.

### Bankai Rules (Plagas Campaign - Updated)

**Unlocking Bankai:**
- Will be unlocked once you have a big "feel something" moment in the plot
- Needs to tie into your lore and/or existing class abilities somehow
- If you haven't "lore unlocked" Bankai by level 13, you'll naturally learn it then

**Using Bankai:**
- Uses full action AND bonus action for that turn
- Can't use again for 1d8 days after that
- Only lasts 1 minute if combat ability, if utility ability could last up to 10 minutes (DM approval)
- Can be an attack, ability, spell, and/or aura
- Near limitless options to create what it does (player proposes, DM assigns dice/rolls/checks)

**Trade-offs:**
- If you go pure offense, might be defense debuff, etc.
- Balanced risk/reward system

**Power Level:**
- Bankai is stronger than first campaign
- Can override any other action or buff from enemy (besides legendary enemies, other Bankai, or other domains)

### The Levels of Power

1. **Base Level Bankai** - Stronger than first campaign
2. **Ultimate Bankai** - More uses, more abilities, more flexibility
3. **Domain Expansion** (Ryoiki Tenkai) - The ultimate form
4. **???** - Unknown higher tier

### Special Level Bonuses

- **Level 14:** You get 1 extra reaction per turn
- **Level 15:** One extra bonus action per turn
- **Level 18:** ??? (Unknown ability unlock)

## Domain Expansion

Domain Expansion (Ryoiki Tenkai) is the ultimate evolution of Bankai, creating a bounded field of absolute control.

### Known Domain Users

**The Voice & Cicero Windblade** - The two now largely rule AETERNUM from the shadows unchallenged after relentlessly training together to master both bankai and domain expansion at a level beyond their physical limits.

## The Seven Seals

After NEJUNE's total destruction by the bewitched tarrasque "The Black Tyrant", an ancient evil seemed to seep into the ruins and surrounding lands in the form of a violet miasma.
